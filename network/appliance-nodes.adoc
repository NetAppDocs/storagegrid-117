You can configure the network ports on StorageGRID appliances to use the port bond modes that meet your requirements for throughput, redundancy, and failover.

The 10/25-GbE ports on the StorageGRID appliances can be configured in Fixed or Aggregate bond mode for connections to the Grid Network and Client Network.

The 1-GbE Admin Network ports can be configured in Independent or Active-Backup mode for connections to the Admin Network.
