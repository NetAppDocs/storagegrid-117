When you first sign in to the Grid Manager, you can use the Dashboard to monitor system activities at a glance. The Dashboard includes information about system health, usage metrics, and operational trends and charts.

== Search field

The *Search* field in the header bar allows you to quickly navigate to a specific page or sidebar entry within the Grid Manager. For example, you can enter *key* to access the Key Management Server page.

== Configure the Dashboard

The Dashboard consists of tabs that contain specific information about the StorageGRID system. Each tab contains categories of information displayed on cards. As needed, you can configure the Dashboard to show or hide tabs or to display, hide, or rearrange cards on each tab. To configure the tabs and cards, select *Configure dashboard*.

The default information displayed on each tab is described in the following tables.

=== Overview tab

[cols="1a,2a,3a" options="header"]
|===

| Default card| Description| Additional details
|Health status
|Summarizes the system's health. A green checkmark means that there are no current alerts and all grid nodes are connected. Any other icon means that there is at least one current alert or disconnected node.
|You might see one or more of the following links:

* *Grid details*: Appears if any nodes are disconnected (xref:monitoring-node-connection-states.adoc[connection state Unknown or Administratively Down]). Select the link or the blue or gray icon to determine which node or nodes are affected.
* *Current alerts*: Appears if any xref:viewing-current-alerts.adoc[alerts are currently active]. Select the link or *Critical*, *Major*, or *Minor* to see the details on the *ALERTS* > *Current* page.
* *Recently resolved alerts*: Appears if any xref:viewing-resolved-alerts.adoc[alerts triggered in the past week are now resolved]. Select the link to see the details on the *ALERTS* > *Resolved* page.
* *Legacy alarms*: Appears if any xref:viewing-legacy-alarms.adoc[alarms (legacy system)] are currently active. Select the link to see the details on the *SUPPORT* > *Alarms (Legacy)* > *Current alarms* page.
* *License*: Appears if there is an issue with the xref:../admin/updating-storagegrid-license-information.adoc[software license for this StorageGRID system]. Select the link to see the details on the *MAINTENANCE* > *System* > *License* page.

|Data usage breakdown
|Available and used storage capacity in the entire grid, not including archival media.
|For each site in the grid, the percentage and amount of space used are shown, in additional to the total space available for the site.

You can use this information to xref:monitoring-storage-capacity.adoc[compare the used storage with the available storage]. If you have a multi-site grid, you can determine which site is consuming more storage.

|Total objects
|Total number of objects in the grid. If S3 Object Lock is enabled globally or for specific S3 buckets, each object version is included in the total.
|

|Metadata usage breakdown
|Available and used storage capacity for metadata in the entire grid, not including archival media.
|For each site in the grid, the percentage and amount of space used for metadata are shown, in additional to the total metadata space available for the site. The metadata for all objects in the grid is stored at every site.

Use this information to xref:monitoring-storage-capacity.adoc[compare the used and allowed storage for metadata]. The site with the highest metadata usage regulates how much data can be stored in the grid.

|Grid information
|General information for the grid, such as the StorageGRID software serial number and version, site count, node count, licensed storage capacity, and the support term.
|

|Storage over time
|Chart of historical usage for data or metadata over time. If you select Metadata, the chart shown is for the site with the highest metadata usage.

|Current ILM operations and ILM queues for your system. 
|Use this information to monitor your system's workload.

* *Awaiting - Client*: The total number of objects awaiting ILM evaluation from client operations (for example, ingest).
* *Awaiting - Evaluation Rate*: The current rate at which objects are evaluated against the ILM policy in the grid.
* *Scan Period - Estimated*: The estimated time to complete a full ILM scan of all objects.
*Note:* A full scan does not guarantee that ILM has been applied to all objects.

* To see details, select *NODES*. Then, xref:viewing-ilm-tab.adoc[view the ILM tab] for the entire grid, an entire site, or a single Storage Node.
* To see the existing ILM rules, select *ILM* > *Rules*.
* To see the existing ILM policies, select *ILM* > *Policies*.

Displays the number of protocol-specific operations (S3 and Swift) performed by your system.

You can use this information to monitor your system's workloads and efficiencies. Protocol rates are averaged over the last two minutes.
