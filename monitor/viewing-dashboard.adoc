== View the dashboard

The dashboard consists of tabs that contain specific information about the StorageGRID system. Each tab contains categories of information displayed on cards.

You can use the stock dashboard as is. Additionally, you can create custom dashboards that contain only the tabs and cards that are relevant to monitoring your specific implementation of StorageGRID.

The stock dashboard tabs contain cards with the following types of information:

[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Stock dashboard tab| Contains

|Overview
|General information about the grid, such as active alerts, network traffic, and total objects in the grid

|Performance
|Space usage, storage used over time, S3 operations, request duration, error rate.

|Storage
|Tenant quota usage and logical space usage.

|ILM
|Information lifecycle management queue and evaluation rate.

|Nodes
|CPU, data, and memory usage by node. S3 operations by node, node to site distribution.

Some of the cards can be maximized for easier viewing. Select the maximize icon image:../media/icon_dashboard_card_maximize.png[Maximize icon] in the upper right corner of the card. To close a maximized card, select the minimize icon image:../media/icon_dashboard_card_minimize.png[Minimize icon] or select *Close*.
