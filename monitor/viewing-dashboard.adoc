[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Default tab| Contains

|Overview
|General information about the grid, such as active alerts, network traffic, and total objects in the grid

|Performance

|Storage

|ILM
|Information lifecycle management queue and evaluation rate.

|Nodes

Some of the cards can be maximized for easier viewing. Select the maximize icon image:../media/icon_dashboard_card_maximize.png[Maximize icon] in the upper right corner of the card. To close a maximized card, select the minimize icon image:../media/icon_dashboard_card_minimize.png[Minimize icon] or select *Close*.

If you have the xref:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[required permission and access mode], you can perform the following configuration tasks for the Dashboard:
