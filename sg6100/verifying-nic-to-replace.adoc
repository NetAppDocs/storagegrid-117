. From the table on the Nodes page, select an appliance Storage Node.
. Select the *Hardware* tab.

 ** If the StorageGRID Appliance section in Grid Manager does not display, the node selected is not a StorageGRID appliance. Select a different node from the tree view.
 ** If the serial numbers do not match, select a different node from the tree view.

. After you locate the node where the NIC needs to be replaced, write down the Compute controller BMC IP address listed the StorageGRID Appliance section.
+
You can use this IP address to turn on the compute controller identify LED, to help you locate the appliance in the data center.
