 ** If the StorageGRID Appliance section in Grid Manager does not display, the node selected is not a StorageGRID appliance. Select a different node from the tree view.
 ** If the serial numbers do not match, select a different node from the tree view.

. After you locate the node where the NIC needs to be replaced, write down the appliance BMC IP address listed the StorageGRID Appliance section.
