There are two NICs in the two-slot riser assembly: a xxxxx HBA and an Ethernet network adapter. There is only one NIC in the one-slot riser assembly: a xxxxx. The NICs are shown in the picture.

. If you are replacing a NIC on the two-slot riser assembly, locate the alignment hole on the riser assembly (circled) that aligns with a guide pin on the system board to ensure correct riser assembly positioning.
