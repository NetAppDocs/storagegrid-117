[role="quick-margin-para"]
Work with your NetApp account representative to design and plan your new StorageGRID system. Consider these types of questions:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* How much object data do you expect to store initially and over time? 
* Where will that data come from? 
* How many sites do you need?
* How many and what types of nodes do you need at each site? 
* Which StorageGRID networks will you use?
* Do you have any special storage requirements or do you need to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements?

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Review xref:../primer/index.adoc[What is StorageGRID?] and xref:../network/index.adoc[networking guidelines].


.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-2.png[Two] Install nodes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
A StorageGRID system consists of individual hardware-based and software-based nodes. You first install the hardware for each appliance node and configure each Linux or VMware host.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
To complete the installation, you install StorageGRID software on each appliance or software host and connect the nodes into a grid. During this step, you provide site and node names, subnet details, and the IP addresses for your NTP and DNS servers.

* xref:../rhel/index.adoc[Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS]
* xref:../sg100-1000/index.adoc[Install Ubuntu or Debian]
* xref:../sg100-1000/index.adoc[Install VMware]


.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-3.png[Three] Sign in and configure

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The Grid Manager is the main user interface and where you will configure StorageGRID. The configuration tasks depend on how you will use StorageGRID. At a minimum, you set up users and groups, connect to S3 and Swift client applications, manage various storage and security settings, and create tenant accounts.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Set up ILM

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You manage every object in your StorageGRID system by configuring an information lifecycle management (ILM) policy that consists of one or more ILM rules. The ILM rules instruct StorageGRID how to create and distribute copies of object data and how to manage those copies over time.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Learn how: xref:../ilm/index.adoc[Manage objects with ILM]

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Use StorageGRID

[role="quick-margin-para"]
After the initial configuration is complete, StorageGRID tenant accounts can use S3 and Swift client applications to ingest, retrieve, and delete objects.

* xref:../tenant/index.adoc[Use the Swift REST API]


.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-6.png[Six] Monitor and troubleshoot

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can use the Grid Manager Dashboard to see the high-level status of your StorageGRID system or use the Nodes page to see details for the entire grid, each site, and each node. You can also review audit logs to analyze all system activity.

* xref:../audit/index.adoc[Review audit logs]


.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-7.png[Seven] Expand and maintain

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can add nodes or sites to expand the capacity or functionality of your system. You can also perform various maintenance procedures to recover from failures or to keep your StorageGRID system up-to-date and performing efficiently.
