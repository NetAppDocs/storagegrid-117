When you need more detailed information about your StorageGRID system than the Dashboard provides, you can use the Nodes page to view metrics for the entire grid, each site in the grid, and each node at a site.

The Nodes table lists all the sites and nodes in your StorageGRID system. Summary information is displayed for each node. If a node has an active alert, an icon appears next to the node name.  If the node is connected and has no active alerts, no  icon is shown.

== Prometheus metrics

The Prometheus service on Admin Nodes collects time series metrics from the services on all nodes.

The metrics collected by Prometheus are used in a number of places in the Grid Manager:

* *Nodes page*: The graphs and charts on the tabs available from the Nodes page use the Grafana visualization tool to display the time-series metrics collected by Prometheus. Grafana displays time-series data in graph and chart formats, while Prometheus serves as the backend data source.

* *Alerts*: Alerts are triggered at specific severity levels when alert rule conditions that use Prometheus metrics evaluate as true.
* *Grid Management API*: You can use Prometheus metrics in custom alert rules or with external automation tools to monitor your StorageGRID system. A complete list of Prometheus metrics is available from the Grid Management API. (From the top of the Grid Manager, select the help icon and select *API Documentation* > *metrics*.) While more than a thousand metrics are available, only a relatively small number are required to monitor the most critical StorageGRID operations.
+
NOTE: Metrics that include _private_ in their names are intended for internal use only and are subject to change between StorageGRID releases without notice.

* The *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Diagnostics* page and the *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Metrics* page: These pages, which are primarily intended for use by technical support, provide a number of tools and charts that use the values of Prometheus metrics.

NOTE: Some features and menu items within the Metrics page are intentionally non-functional and are subject to change.

== StorageGRID attributes

Attributes report values and statuses for many of the functions of the StorageGRID system. Attribute values are available for each grid node, each site, and the entire grid.

StorageGRID attributes are used in a number of places in the Grid Manager:

* *Nodes page*: Many of the values shown on the Nodes page are StorageGRID attributes. (Prometheus metrics are also shown on the Nodes pages.)
* *Alarms*: When attributes reach defined threshold values, StorageGRID alarms (legacy system) are triggered at specific severity levels.
* *Grid Topology tree*: Attribute values are shown in the Grid Topology tree (*SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*).
* *Events*: System events occur when certain attributes record an error or fault condition for a node, including errors such as network errors.

=== Attribute values

Attributes are reported on a best-effort basis and are approximately correct. Attribute updates can be lost under some circumstances, such as the crash of a service or the failure and rebuild of a grid node.

In addition, propagation delays might slow the reporting of attributes. Updated values for most attributes are sent to the StorageGRID system at fixed intervals. It can take several minutes before an update is visible in the system, and two attributes that change more or less simultaneously can be reported at slightly different times.
