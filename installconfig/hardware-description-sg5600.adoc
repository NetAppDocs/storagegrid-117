The StorageGRID SG5600 appliance is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID grid.

The StorageGRID SG5600 appliance includes the following components:

[options="header"]
|===
| Component| Description
a|
E5600SG controller
a|
Compute serverThe E5600SG controller runs the Linux operating system and the StorageGRID software.

This controller connects to the following:

* The Admin, Grid, and Client Networks for the StorageGRID system
* The E2700 controller, using dual SAS paths (active/active) with the E5600SG controller operating as the initiator

a|
E2700 controller
a|
Storage controllerThe E2700 controller operates as a standard E-Series storage array in simplex mode, and runs the SANtricity operating system (controller firmware).

This controller connects to the following:

* The management network where SANtricity Storage Manager is installed
* The E5600SG controller, using dual SAS paths (active/active) with the E2700 controller operating as the target

The SG5600 appliance also includes the following components, depending on the model:

NOTE: The E5600SG controller is highly customized for use in the StorageGRID appliance. All other components operate as described in E-Series documentation, except as indicated in these instructions.

The maximum raw storage available on each StorageGRID appliance Storage Node is fixed, based on the appliance model and configuration. You cannot expand the available storage by adding a shelf with additional drives.

== StorageGRID appliance features

The StorageGRID SG5600 appliance provides an integrated storage solution for creating a new StorageGRID system or for expanding the capacity of an existing system.

The StorageGRID appliance provides the following features:

* Combines the StorageGRID Storage Node computing and storage elements into a single, efficient, integrated solution
* Simplifies the installation and configuration of a Storage Node, automating most of the process required
* Provides a high-density storage solution with two enclosure options: one that is 2U and one that is 4U
* Uses 10-GbE IP interfaces directly to the Storage Node, without the need for intermediate storage interfaces such as FC or iSCSI
* Can be used in a hybrid grid environment that uses StorageGRID appliances and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes
* Includes preconfigured storage and comes preloaded with the StorageGRID Appliance Installer (on the E5600SG controller) for field-ready software deployment and integration

== Hardware diagrams

The SG5612 and SG5660 models of the StorageGRID appliance both include an E2700 controller and an E5600SG controller. You should review the diagrams to learn the differences between the models and the controllers.
