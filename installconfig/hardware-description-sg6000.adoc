[.lead]
The StorageGRID SG6000 appliances are integrated storage and computing platforms that operate as Storage Nodes in a StorageGRID system. These appliances can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

The SG6000 appliances provide the following features:

* Available in two models:
 ** SG6060, which includes 60 drives and supports expansion shelves.
 ** SGF6024, which offers 24 solid state drives (SSDs).
* Integrate the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Include the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Include SANtricity System Manager for managing and monitoring the storage controllers and drives.
* Include a baseboard management controller (BMC) for monitoring and diagnosing the hardware in the compute controller.
* Support up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Support Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.

== SG6060 overview

The StorageGRID SG6060 appliance includes a compute controller and a storage controller shelf that contains two storage controllers and 60 drives. Optionally, 60-drive expansion shelves can be added to the appliance.

== Controllers in SG6000 appliances

Each model of the StorageGRID SG6000 appliance includes an SG6000-CN compute controller in a 1U enclosure and duplex E-Series storage controllers in a 2U or 4U enclosure, depending on the model. Review the diagrams to learn more about each type of controller.

=== All appliances: SG6000-CN compute controller

* Provides compute resources for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is retrieved from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E-Series storage controllers and operates as the initiator.
