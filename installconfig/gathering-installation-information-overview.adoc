As you install and configure the StorageGRID appliance, you must make decisions and gather information about Ethernet switch ports, IP addresses, and port and network bond modes. 

The installation information required to install and configure the hardware is unique for each appliance type. Record the information for each network you connect to the appliance before you install it.
