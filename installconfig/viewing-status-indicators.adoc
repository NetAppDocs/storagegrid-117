[[general_boot_codes_sg6000]]
*General boot-up codes*

During boot-up or after a hard reset of the SG6000-CN controller, the following occurs:

. The baseboard management controller (BMC) logs codes for the boot-up sequence, including any errors that occur.
. The power button lights up.
. If any errors occur during boot-up, the alarm LED lights up.
+
To view the boot-up and error codes, you must xref:accessing-bmc-interface.adoc[access the BMC interface].

[[boot_codes_sg6000_storage_controller]]
*Boot-up status codes for SG6000 storage controllers*

Each storage controller has a seven-segment display that provides status codes as the controller powers up. The status codes are the same for both the E2800 controller and the EF570 controller.

For descriptions of these codes, see the E-Series system monitoring information for you storage controller type.

.Steps

. During boot-up, monitor progress by viewing the codes shown on the seven-segment display for each storage controller.
+
The seven-segment display on each storage controller shows the repeating sequence *OS*, *Sd*, `*_blank_*` to indicate that the controller is performing start-of-day processing.

. After the controllers have booted up, confirm that each storage controller shows 99, which is the default ID for an E-Series controller shelf.
+
Make sure this value is displayed on both storage controllers, as shown in this example E2800 controller.
+
image::../media/seven_segment_display_codes_for_e2800.gif[Seven-Segment Display Codes for E2800]

. If one or both controllers show other values, see xref:troubleshooting-hardware-installation.adoc[Troubleshoot hardware installation (SG6000)] and confirm you completed the installation steps correctly. If you are unable to resolve the problem, contact technical support.

[[boot_codes_sg5700]]
*SG5700 boot-up status codes*

The seven-segment displays on each controller show status and error codes as the appliance powers up.

The E2800 controller and the E5700SG controller display different statuses and error codes.

To understand what these codes mean, see the following resources:

.Steps

. During boot-up, monitor progress by viewing the codes shown on the seven-segment displays.
 ** The seven-segment display on the E2800 controller shows the repeating sequence *OS*, *Sd*, `*_blank_*` to indicate that it is performing start-of-day processing.
 ** The seven-segment display on the E5700SG controller shows a sequence of codes, ending with *AA* and *FF*.
. After the controllers have booted up, confirm the seven-segment displays show the following:

Shows *HO*, followed by a repeating sequence of two numbers.

----
HO -- IP address for Admin Network -- IP address for Grid Network HO
----

In the sequence, the first set of numbers is the DHCP-assigned IP address for the controller's management port 1. This address is used to connect the controller to the Admin Network for StorageGRID. The second set of numbers is the DHCP-assigned IP address used to connect the appliance to the Grid Network for StorageGRID.

*Note:* If an IP address could not be assigned using DHCP, 0.0.0.0 is displayed.

. If the seven-segment displays show other values, see xref:troubleshooting-hardware-installation.adoc[Troubleshoot hardware installation (SG5700)] and confirm you completed the installation steps correctly. If you are unable to resolve the problem, contact technical support.

[[status_indicators_e5700sg_controller]]
*Status indicators on E5700SG controller*

The seven-segment display and the LEDs on the E5700SG controller show status and error codes while the appliance powers up and while the hardware is initializing. You can use these displays to determine status and troubleshoot errors.

After the StorageGRID Appliance Installer has started, you should periodically review the status indicators on the E5700SG controller.

[[general_boot_codes_sg5700]]
*General boot-up codes*

During boot-up or after a hard reset of the appliance, the following occurs:

. The seven-segment display on the E5700SG controller shows a general sequence of codes that is not specific to the controller. The general sequence ends with the codes AA and FF.
. Boot-up codes that are specific to the E5700SG controller appear.

.SG5600

The appliance controllers include indicators that help you determine the status of the appliance controller:

* <<boot_error_codes_sg5600_controller,Boot-up status and error codes on SG5600 controllers>>
* <<seven_segment_codes_e5600sg,E5600SG controller seven-segment display codes>>
* <<general_boot_codes_sg5600,General boot-up codes>>
* <<normal_boot_codes_sg5600,Normal boot-up codes>>
* <<error_codes_e5600sg_controller,E5600SG controller error codes>>

Use this information to help xref:troubleshooting-hardware-installation.adoc[troubleshoot the storage appliance hardware installation].

[[boot_error_codes_sg5600_controller]]
*Boot-up status and error codes on SG5600 controllers*

The seven-segment display on each controller shows status and error codes when the appliance powers up, while the hardware is initializing, and when the hardware fails and must back out of the initialization. If you are monitoring the progress or troubleshooting, you should watch the sequence of the codes as they appear.

The status and error codes for the E5600SG controller are not the same as those for the E2700 controller.

.Steps

. During boot-up, view the codes shown on the seven-segment displays to monitor progress.
. To review error codes for the E5600SG controller, see the seven-segment display status and error code information.
. To review error codes for the E2700 controller, see the E2700 controller documentation on the Support Site.

[[seven_segment_codes_e5600sg]]
*E5600SG controller seven-segment display codes*

The seven-segment display on the E5600SG controller shows status and error codes while the appliance powers up and while the hardware is initializing. You can use these codes to determine status and troubleshoot errors.

When reviewing status and error codes on the E5600SG controller, you should look at the following types of codes:

* *General boot-up codes*
+
Represent the standard boot-up events.

* *Normal boot-up codes*
+
Represent the normal boot-up events that occur in the appliance.

* *Error codes*
+
Indicate issues during the boot-up events.

StorageGRID controls only the following LEDs on the E5600SG controller and only after the StorageGRID Appliance Installer has started:

* Service Action Allowed LED
* Service Action Required LED
* Seven-segment display

image::../media/appliance_e5600_leds.gif[LEDs and seven-segment display on E5600SG controller]

The decimal points on the seven-segment display are not used by the StorageGRID appliance:

* The upper decimal point adjacent to the least significant digit is the platform diagnostic LED.
+
This is turned on during reset and initial hardware configuration. Otherwise, it is turned off.

* The lower decimal point adjacent to the most significant digit is turned off.

To diagnose other issues, you might want to look at these resources:

* To see all other hardware and environmental diagnostic information, see the E-Series operating system hardware diagnostics.
+
This includes looking for hardware issues such as power, temperature, and disk drives. The appliance relies on the E-Series operating system to monitor all platform environmental statuses.

* To determine firmware and driver issues, look at the link lights on the SAS and network ports.
+
For details, see the E-Series E5600 documentation.

[[general_boot_codes_sg5600]]
*General boot-up codes*

During boot-up or after a hard reset of the hardware, the Service Action Allowed and the Service Action Required LEDs come on while the hardware is initializing. The seven-segment display shows a sequence of codes that are the same for E-Series hardware and not specific to the E5600SG controller.

During boot-up, the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) controls the functions and initialization on the hardware.
