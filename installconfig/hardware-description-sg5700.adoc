The SG5700 StorageGRID appliance is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID grid. The appliance can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

The StorageGRID SG5700 appliance provides the following features:

* Integrates the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes E-Series SANtricity System Manager for hardware management and monitoring.
* Supports up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Supports Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.

The SG5700 appliance is available in two models: the SG5712 and the SG5760. Both models include the following components:

== Controllers in StorageGRID appliance

Both the SG5712 and SG5760 models of the StorageGRID appliance include an E5700SG controller and an E2800 controller. You should review the diagrams to learn the differences between the controllers.

=== E5700SG controller

* Operates as the compute server for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is accessed from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E2800 controller and operates as the initiator.

This figure shows the connectors on the back of the E5700SG controller.
