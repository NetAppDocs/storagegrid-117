[.lead]
The StorageGRID SGF6112 appliance operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID system. The appliance can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

The SGF6112 appliance provide the following features:

* 12 NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) SSD drives with integrated compute and storage controllers. 
* Integrates the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes a baseboard management controller (BMC) for monitoring and diagnosing the hardware in the compute controller.
* Supports up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.

== SGF6112 hardware description
The StorageGRID SGF6112 is an all-flash appliance that features a compact design with compute controller and storage controller integrated into a 1 RU chassis. The appliance supports 12 SSD NVMe drives with a storage capacity of up to 15.3TB per drive.

=== Resilient object storage
The SGF6112 is designed with SSDs in a RAID that provides the following data protection features: 

* Ability to function after the failure of a single SSD with no impact on object availability.
* Ability to continue to function after multiple SSD failures with a minimum necessary reduction in object availability (based on the design of the underlying RAID scheme).
* Fully recoverable, while in service, from any number of SSD failures that do not result in extreme damage to the RAID housing the node's root volume (the StorageGRID operating system).

=== SGF6112 hardware components
The SGF6112 appliance includes the following components:
