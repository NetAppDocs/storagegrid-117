If you enable node encryption, the disks in your appliance can be protected by secure key management server (KMS) encryption against physical loss or removal from the site. You must select and enable node encryption during appliance installation and cannot unselect node encryption once the KMS encryption process starts.

(Pick up from existing appliance guides - already common.)
