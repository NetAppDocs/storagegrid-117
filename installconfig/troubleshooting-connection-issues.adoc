.Steps

. If you are unable to connect to SANtricity System Manager:
 .. Try to ping the appliance using the IP address for either storage controller on the management network for SANtricity System Manager: +
`*ping _Storage_Controller_IP_*`
 .. If you receive no response from the ping, confirm you are using the correct IP address.
+
Use the IP address for management port 1 on either storage controller.

== SG6060 expansion shelves do not appear in Appliance Installer

If you have installed expansion shelves for the SG6060 and they do not appear in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, you should verify that the shelves have been completely installed and powered on.

You can verify that the expansion shelves are connected to the appliance by viewing the following information in the StorageGRID Appliance Installer:

* The *Home* page contains a message about expansion shelves.
+
