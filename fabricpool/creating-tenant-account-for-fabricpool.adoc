Tenant accounts allow client applications to store and retrieve objects on StorageGRID. Each tenant account has its own account ID, authorized groups and users, buckets, and objects.

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.

For the *Define root access* step, specify which user will have the initial Root access permission for the tenant account, based on whether your StorageGRID system uses xref:../admin/using-identity-federation.adoc[identity federation], xref:../admin/configuring-sso.adoc[single sign-on (SSO)], or both.
