After you have obtained the required StorageGRID information, you can go to ONTAP to add StorageGRID as a cloud tier, add the cloud tier as an aggregate, and set volume tiering policies.

NOTE: These instructions describe how to use ONTAP System Manager to add StorageGRID as a cloud tier. You can complete the same configuration using the ONTAP CLI. For instructions, go to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/fabricpool/index.html[ONTAP 9: FabricPool tier management with the CLI^].

== Access ONTAP System Manager

. Access System Manager for the ONTAP cluster you want to tier to StorageGRID.
. Sign in as an administrator for the cluster.
. Navigate to *STORAGE* > *Tiers* > *Add Cloud Tier*.

. Select *StorageGRID* from the list of object store providers.

== Upload or enter values

If you used the FabricPool and S3 Setup wizard and you have ONTAP System Manager version 9.12.1 or later, you can upload the StorageGRID settings directly to the Add Cloud Tier page. 

If you configured StorageGRID manually or you have an earlier version of ONTAP System Manager, you can enter the same values manually.

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

|Name
|A unique name for this cloud tier. You can accept the default value.

|URL style
|Select the default (*Path-Style URL*).

|Server name (FQDN)
|The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) you are using for StorageGRID. For example, `s3.storagegrid.company.com`.

Note the following:

* The domain name that you specify here must match the domain name on the certificate you uploaded or generated for the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint.
* The DNS record for this domain name must map to each IP address you will use to connect to StorageGRID.


|SSL
|Enabled (default).

|Object store certificate
|The CA certificate you use for the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint.

*Note:* If an intermediate CA issued the StorageGRID certificate, you must provide the intermediate CA certificate. If the StorageGRID certificate was issued directly by the Root CA, you must provide the Root CA certificate.

|Port
|The port that FabricPool will use when it connects to StorageGRID. The port number here matches the port you specify for the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint. For example, 10433.

|Access key 
|The access key ID for the StorageGRID tenant account.

|Secret key
|The secret access key for the StorageGRID tenant account.

|Container name
|The name of the StorageGRID bucket you will use with this ONTAP aggregate. For example, `fabricpool-bucket`. 

Note the following:

* The bucket name cannot be changed once the configuration is created.
* The bucket cannot have versioning enabled.
* You must use a different bucket for each ONTAP aggregate that is tiered to StorageGRID.
