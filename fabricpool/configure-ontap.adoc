After you have obtained the required StorageGRID information, you can go to ONTAP to configure the DNS server, add StorageGRID as a cloud tier, add the cloud tier as an aggregate, and set volume tiering policies.

== Configure the DNS server for StorageGRID IP addresses
After configuring high availability groups and load balancer endpoints, you must ensure that the domain name system (DNS) for the ONTAP system includes a record to associate the StorageGRID server name (fully qualified domain name) to the IP address that FabricPool will use to make connections.

The IP address you enter in the DNS record depends on whether you are using an HA group of load-balancing nodes:

* If you have configured a HA group, FabricPool will connect to the virtual IP addresses of that HA group.
* If you are not using a HA group, FabricPool can connect to the StorageGRID Load Balancer service using the IP address of any Gateway Node or Admin Node.

You must also ensure that the DNS record references all required endpoint domain names, including any wildcard names.

 
== Enter StorageGRID values in ONTAP System Manager

To enter the StorageGRID values into ONTAP System Manager, go to the Add Cloud Tier page for the cluster.

. Access System Manager for the ONTAP cluster you want to tier to StorageGRID.
. Sign in as an administrator for the cluster.
. Navigate to *STORAGE* > *Tiers* > *Add Cloud Tier*.

. Select *StorageGRID* from the list of object store providers.

The following table describes these fields in more detail. 

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

|Name
|A unique name for this cloud tier. You can accept the default value.

|URL style
|Select the default (*Path-Style URL*).

|Server name (FQDN)
|The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint. For example, `s3.storagegrid.company.com`.


Note the following:

* The domain name that you specify here must match the domain name on the CA certificate you upload for the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint.
* The DNS record for this domain name in ONTAP must map to each IP address you will use to connect to StorageGRID.


|SSL
|Enabled (default).

|Object store certificate
|The CA certificate you use for the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint.

*Note:* If an intermediate CA issued the StorageGRID certificate, you must provide the intermediate CA certificate. If the StorageGRID certificate was issued directly by the Root CA, you must provide the Root CA certificate.

|Port
|The port that FabricPool will use when it connects to StorageGRID. The port number here matches the port you specify for the StorageGRID load balancer endpoint. For example, 10433.

|Access key 
|The access key for the StorageGRID tenant account.

|Secret key
|The secret access key for the StorageGRID tenant account.

|Container name
|The name of the StorageGRID bucket you will use with this ONTAP cluster. For example, fabricpool-bucket. 

You can create this bucket in StorageGRID or, starting with ONTAP 9.10 System Manager, you can create the bucket with the FabricPool setup wizard.

Note the following:

* The bucket name cannot be changed once the configuration is created.
* The bucket cannot have versioning enabled.
* You must use a different bucket for each ONTAP cluster that will tier data to StorageGRID.
