StorageGRID uses a load balancer to manage the workload from client applications, such as FabricPool. Load balancing maximizes speed and connection capacity across multiple Storage Nodes. 

When configuring StorageGRID for use with FabricPool, you must configure a load balancer endpoint and upload or generate a load balancer endpoint certificate, which is used to secure the connection between ONTAP and StorageGRID. 

To use the FabricPool setup wizard to complete this task, go to xref:use-fabricpool-setup-wizard-steps.adoc[Access and complete the FabricPool setup wizard].


.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission.
* You have reviewed the general xref:../admin/managing-load-balancing.adoc[considerations for load balancing] as well as the xref:best-practices-for-load-balancing.adoc[best practices for load balancing for FabricPool].

.Steps
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *Load balancer endpoints*.

. Select *Create*.

. For the *Enter endpoint details* step, complete the following fields.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Field| Description

|Name
|A descriptive name for the endpoint.

|Port
|The StorageGRID port you want to use for load balancing. This field defaults to 10433 for the first endpoint you create, but you can enter any unused external port. If you enter 80 or 443, the endpoint is configured only on Gateway Nodes. These ports are reserved on Admin Nodes.

*Note:* Ports used by other grid services are not permitted. See the 
xref:../network/network-port-reference.adoc[Network port reference].

You will provide this number to ONTAP when you attach StorageGRID as a FabricPool cloud tier.

|Client type
|Select *S3*.

|Network protocol
|Select *HTTPS*.

*Note*: Communicating with StorageGRID without TLS encryption is supported but not recommended.

|===

. For the *Select binding mode* step, specify the binding mode. The binding mode controls how the endpoint is accessed&#8212;using any IP address or using specific IP addresses and network interfaces.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Option| Description

|Global (recommended)
|Clients can access the endpoint using the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the IP address of any Gateway Node or Admin Node, or the virtual IP (VIP) address of any HA group. 

|Node interfaces
|Clients must access the endpoint using the IP address of a selected node and network interface.

|HA groups VIPs
|Clients can only access the endpoint using a VIP address of an HA group. Use this selection only if you require much higher levels of isolation of workloads.

|===
 

. For the *Tenant access* step, select one of the following:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Field| Description

|Allow all tenants (default)
|All tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets. 


*Allow all tenants* is almost always the appropriate option for the load balancer endpoint used for FabricPool. 

You must select this option if you have not yet created any tenant accounts. 

|Allow selected tenants
|Only the selected tenant accounts can use this endpoint to access their buckets.

|Block selected tenants
|The selected tenant accounts cannot use this endpoint to access their buckets. All other tenants can use this endpoint.

|===


. For the *Attach certificate* step, select one of the following:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Field| Description

|Upload certificate (recommended)
|Use this option to upload a CA-signed server certificate, certificate private key, and optional CA bundle.

|Generate certificate
|Use this option to generate a self-signed certificate. See xref:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.adoc[Configure load balancer endpoints] for details of what to enter.

|Use StorageGRID S3 and Swift certificate
|This option is available only if you have already uploaded or generated a custom version of the StorageGRID global certificate. See xref:../admin/configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-storage-node.adoc[Configure S3 and Swift API certificates] for details.

|===

. Select *Create*.

NOTE: Changes to an endpoint certificate can take up to 15 minutes to be applied to all nodes.
