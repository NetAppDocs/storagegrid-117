Before attaching StorageGRID as a FabricPool cloud tier, learn about StorageGRID high availability (HA) groups and review the best practices for using HA groups with FabricPool.

== What is an HA group?

A high availability (HA) group is a collection of interfaces from multiple StorageGRID Gateway Nodes, Admin Nodes, or both. An HA group helps to keep client data connections available. If the active interface in the HA group fails, a backup interface can manage the workload with little impact on FabricPool operations.

Each HA group provides highly available access to the shared services on the associated nodes. For example, an HA group that consists of interfaces only on Gateway Nodes or on both Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes provides highly available access to the shared Load Balancer service.

To create an HA group, you perform these general steps:

. Select network interfaces for one or more Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes. You can select the Grid Network interface (eth0), Client Network interface (eth2), or a VLAN interface.

TIP: If you plan to use a VLAN interface to segregate FabricPool traffic, a network administrator must first configure a trunk interface and the corresponding VLAN on the appropriate switches, and ensure the trunk ports are connected to the appropriate Gateway or Admin Nodes. Each VLAN is identified by a numeric ID or tag. For example, your network might use VLAN 100 for FabricPool traffic.

. Assign at least one but no more than 16 virtual IP (VIP) addresses to the group. ONTAP establishes connections with all IP addresses. The IP addresses are picked up in a round-robin method when connections are established.

. Specify one interface to be the Primary interface and determine the priority order for any Backup interfaces. The Primary interface is the active interface unless a failure occurs.

If the HA group includes more than one interface and the Primary interface fails, the VIP addresses move to the first backup interface in the priority order. If that interface fails, the VIP addresses move to the next backup interface, and so on. This failover process generally takes only a few seconds and is fast enough that client applications should experience little impact and can rely on normal retry behaviors to continue operation.  

When the failure is resolved and a higher priority interface becomes available again, the VIP addresses are automatically moved to the highest priority interface that is available.

== Using HA groups

The best practices for creating a StorageGRID HA group for FabricPool depend on the workload:

* If you plan to use FabricPool with primary workload data, you must create a HA group that includes at least two load-balancing nodes to prevent data retrieval interruption.
* If you plan to use the FabricPool snapshot-only volume tiering policy or non-primary local performance tiers (for example, disaster recovery locations or NetApp SnapMirrorÂ® destinations), you can configure an HA group with only one node.

These instructions describe setting up an HA group for Active-Backup HA (one node is active and one node is backup). However, you might prefer to use DNS Round Robin or Active-Active HA. To learn the benefits of these other HA configurations, see link:../admin/configuration-options-for-ha-groups.html[Configuration options for HA groups].
