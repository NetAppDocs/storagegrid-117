[.lead]
The TLS and SSH policy determines which protocols and ciphers are used to establish secure TLS connections with client applications and secure SSH connections to internal StorageGRID services. In general, use the default Modern policy, unless your system needs to be Common Criteria-compliant or you need to use other ciphers.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission.

.About this task

Select a security policy to control how TLS and SSH encrypt data in motion.

.Steps
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security settings* > *TLS and SSH policies*.

. Select *View details* to review each policy.
+

. Select *Use policy* to apply one of the provided policies.
A red checkmark with *Current policy* is seen on the policy that is applied.
+

NOTE: Modern compatibility is the selected default policy. Some StorageGRID services have not been updated to use the ciphers in these policies.

|Policy
|Description

|Modern compatibility
|Use this policy if you need strong encryption. This policy is compatible with most TLS and SSH clients. You can use this default policy unless you have special requirements.

|Legacy compatibility
|Use this policy if you need additional compatibility options to support older clients. The additional options in Legacy policy can be less secure than the Modern compatibility policy.

|Common Criteria
|Matches the test configuration used for Common Criteria certification.

|FIPS strict
|The same as the Common Criteria policy, but removes the transitional ciphers and enables FIPS mode in OpenSSL. Using this policy might reduce performance.

|Custom
|You can create a custom policy to apply your own ciphers.  Custom policy helps you to customize and apply your own security policy. You can edit or modify the existing policy ciphers to create you own custom policy. You must use caution and validate the policy you provide.

. You can also create a custom policy to apply your ciphers as follows:

.. Select *View details* for one of the provided policies.
.. Select *Copy to clipboard* and *Cancel*.
.. Select *Configure and use* from the *Custom policy*. 
.. Paste the JSON you copied and make required changes to create a custom policy that meets your requirements.
.. Select *Use policy*.
