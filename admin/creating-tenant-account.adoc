[.lead]
You must create at least one tenant account to control access to the storage in your StorageGRID system.

The Grid Manager provides a wizard that takes you through the steps for creating a tenant account. The steps vary based on whether xref:using-identity-federation.adoc[identity federation] and xref:configuring-sso.adoc[single sign-on] are configured and whether the Grid Manager account you use to create the tenant account belongs to an admin group with the Root access permission.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access or Tenant accounts permission.
* If the tenant account will use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager, and you want to grant Root access permission for the tenant account to a federated group, you have imported that federated group into the Grid Manager. You do not need to assign any Grid Manager permissions to this admin group. See the xref:managing-admin-groups.adoc[instructions for managing admin groups].
* If you want to allow an S3 tenant to clone account data and replicate bucket objects to another grid in a grid federation connection:

** You have xref:grid-federation-manage-connection.adoc[created the grid federation connection].
** The status of the connection is *Connected*.
** You have Root access permission.

|Description (optional)
|A description to help identify the tenant.

|Client type
|The type of client you want to create, either *S3* or *Swift*.

|Storage quota (optional)
|If you want this tenant to have a storage quota, a numerical value for the quota and the units (GB, TB, or PB).

|===

[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

|Allow platform services (S3 only)
|The tenant can use platform services such as Cloud Mirroring. See xref:manage-platform-services-for-tenants.adoc[Manage platform services for S3 tenant accounts].

|Use own identity source 
|The tenant can configure and manage its own identity source for federated groups and users. You cannot select this option if you have xref:configuring-sso.adoc[configured single-sign-on (SSO)] for your StorageGRID system.

|Allow S3 select (S3 only)
|The tenant can issue S3 SelectObjectContent API requests to filter and retrieve object data. See xref:manage-s3-select-for-tenant-accounts.adoc[Manage S3 Select for tenant accounts].

*Important*: SelectObjectContent requests can decrease load-balancer performance for all S3 clients and all tenants. Enable this feature only when required and only for trusted tenants.

|Allow account synchronization and cross-grid replication (S3 only)
|The tenant can use one or more grid federation connections for account synchronization and cross-grid federation. See xref:grid-federation-overview.adoc[Use grid federation: Overview].

|===

. If you selected *Allow account synchronization and cross-grid replication*, select one or more of the available grid federation connections.

. Select *Continue*.

== Define root access

. Define root access for the tenant account, based on whether your StorageGRID system uses identity federation, single sign-on (SSO), or both.
