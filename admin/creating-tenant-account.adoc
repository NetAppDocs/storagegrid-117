[.lead]
You must create at least one tenant account to control access to the storage in your StorageGRID system.

The steps for creating a tenant account vary based on whether xref:using-identity-federation.adoc[identity federation] and xref:configuring-sso.adoc[single sign-on] are configured and whether the Grid Manager account you use to create the tenant account belongs to an admin group with the Root access permission.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access or Tenant accounts permission.
* If the tenant account will use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager, and you want to grant Root access permission for the tenant account to a federated group, you have imported that federated group into the Grid Manager. You do not need to assign any Grid Manager permissions to this admin group. See  xref:managing-admin-groups.adoc[Manage admin groups].
* If you want to allow an S3 tenant to clone account data and replicate bucket objects to another grid using a grid federation connection:

** You have xref:grid-federation-create-connection.adoc[configured the grid federation connection].
** The status of the connection is *Connected*.
** You have Root access permission.
** You have reviewed the considerations for xref:grid-federation-manage-tenants.adoc[managing the permitted tenants for a grid federation connection].

== Access the wizard

. Select *TENANTS*.

. Select *Create*.

== Enter details

. Enter details for the tenant.
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

|Name
|A name for the tenant account. Tenant names do not need to be unique. When the tenant account is created, it receives a unique, 20-digit account ID.

|Description (optional)
|A description to help identify the tenant.

If you are creating a tenant that will use a grid federation connection, optionally, use this field to help identify which is the source tenant and which is the destination tenant. For example, this description for a tenant created on Grid 1 will also appear for the tenant replicated to Grid 2: “This tenant was created on Grid 1.”

|Client type
|The type of client protocol this tenant will use, either *S3* or *Swift*.

*Note*: Support for Swift client applications has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

|Storage quota (optional)
|If you want this tenant to have a storage quota, a numerical value for the quota and the units.

|===

. Select *Continue*.

== Select permissions

. Optionally, select any permissions you want this tenant to have.
+
[NOTE]
Some of these permissions have additional requirements. For details, select the help icon for each permission.
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Permission | If selected...

|Allow platform services (S3 only)
|The tenant can use platform services such as CloudMirror. See xref:manage-platform-services-for-tenants.adoc[Manage platform services for S3 tenant accounts].

|Use own identity source 
|The tenant can configure and manage its own identity source for federated groups and users. This option is disabled if you have xref:configuring-sso.adoc[configured SSO] for your StorageGRID system.

|Allow S3 Select (S3 only)
|The tenant can issue S3 SelectObjectContent API requests to filter and retrieve object data. See xref:manage-s3-select-for-tenant-accounts.adoc[Manage S3 Select for tenant accounts].

*Important*: SelectObjectContent requests can decrease load-balancer performance for all S3 clients and all tenants. Enable this feature only when required and only for trusted tenants.

|Use grid federation connection (S3 only)
|The tenant can use a grid federation connection and enable account clone and cross-grid replication from the Tenant Manager. See xref:grid-federation-overview.adoc[What is grid federation].

*Note*: You can only select *Use grid federation connection* when you are creating a new S3 tenant; you can't select this permission for an existing tenant.

|===

. If you selected *Use grid federation connection*, select one of the available grid federation connections.

. Select *Continue*.

== Define root access and create tenant

. Define root access for the tenant account, based on whether your StorageGRID system uses identity federation, single sign-on (SSO), or both.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===

| Option 
| Do this

|If identity federation is not enabled 
|Specify the password to use when signing into the tenant as the local root user.

|If identity federation is enabled
|Select an existing federated group to have Root access permission for the tenant.

Optionally specify the password to use when signing in to the tenant as the local root user.

|If both identity federation and single sign-on (SSO) are enabled
|Select an existing federated group to have Root access permission for the tenant. No local users can sign in.

|===

. Select *Create tenant*.
+
A success message appears, and the new tenant is listed on the Tenants page. To learn how to view tenant details and monitor tenant activity, see xref:../monitor/monitoring-tenant-activity.adoc[Monitor tenant activity].

. If you selected the *Use grid federation connection* permission for the tenant, follow these additional steps:

.. Select the tenant's name to display the tenant details page.
+ 
If you are viewing the tenant from its source grid (the grid where the tenant was created), a banner on the details page reminds you that the tenant was cloned to another grid. If you edit or delete this tenant, your changes will not be synced to the other grid.

.. Optionally select the *Grid federation* tab to learn more about the connection, including connection status, remote hostname, and the most recent error to occur when data was being replicated from this tenant's buckets to the other grid in the connection.

.. Confirm that an identical tenant was replicated to the other grid in the connection.
+
The tenants on both grids will have the same 20-digit account ID, name, description, quota, and permissions.

.. If you provided a local root user password when defining root access, xref:changing-password-for-tenant-local-root-user.adoc[change the password for the local root user] for the replicated tenant. 
+
For security reasons, this password is not copied to the other grid.   

== Sign in to tenant (optional)
As required, you can sign in to the new tenant now to complete the configuration, or you can sign in to the tenant later. The sign-in steps depend on whether you are signed in to the Grid Manager using the default port (443) or a restricted port. See xref:controlling-access-through-firewalls.adoc[Control access through firewalls].

=== Sign in now

[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===

| If you are using...| Do this...

|Port 443 and you set a password for the local root user
|
. Select *Sign in as root*.
+
When you sign in, links appear for configuring buckets, identity federation, groups, and users.

. Select the links to configure the tenant account.
+
Each link opens the corresponding page in the Tenant Manager. To complete the page, see the xref:../tenant/index.adoc[instructions for using tenant accounts].


|Port 443 and you did not set a password for the local root user
|Select *Sign in*, and enter the credentials for a user in the Root access federated group.

|A restricted port
|
. Select *Finish*
. Select *Restricted* in the Tenant table to learn more about accessing this tenant account.
+
The URL for the Tenant Manager has this format:
+
`https://_FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port_/?accountId=_20-digit-account-id_/`
+
** `_FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP_` is a fully qualified domain name or the IP address of an Admin Node
** `_port_` is the tenant-only port
** `_20-digit-account-id_` is the tenant's unique account ID
