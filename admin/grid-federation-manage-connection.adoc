== [[edit_grid_fed_connection]]Edit a grid federation connection

You can edit a grid federation connection by signing in to the primary Admin Node on either grid in the connection. After you make changes to the first grid, you must download a new verification file and upload it to the other grid.

NOTE: While the connection is being edited, account clone or cross-grid replication requests will continue to use the existing connection settings. Any edits you make to the first grid are not used until they have been uploaded to the second grid, saved, and tested. 

=== Start editing the connection

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node on either grid.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Edit the connection details using the *Actions* menu on the Grid federation page or the details page for a specific connection. See xref:grid-federation-create-connection.adoc[Create grid federation connections] for details about what to enter.

.. Select *Edit*.
.. Enter the new information.

--

====


. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are signed in to.
. Select *Save and continue*.
+
The new values are saved, but they will not be applied to the connection until you have uploaded the new verification file on the other grid. 

. Select *Download verification file*.
+
To download this file at a later time, go to the details page for the connection.

. Locate the downloaded file (`_connection-name_.grid-federation`), and save it to a safe location.
+
[IMPORTANT]
The verification file contains secrets and must be securely stored and transmitted.

. Select *Close* to return to the Grid federation page. 

. Confirm that the *Connection status* is *Pending edit*.
+
NOTE: If the connection status was something other than *Connected* when you started editing the connection, it will not change to *Pending edit*.

. Provide the `_connection-name_.grid-federation` file to the grid admin for the other grid.

=== Finish editing the connection

Finish ending the connection by uploading the verification file on the other grid.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Select *Upload verification file* to access the upload page. 

. Select *Upload verification file*. Then, browse to and select the file that was downloaded from the first grid.

. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are currently signed in to.

. Select *Save and test*.
+
If the connection can be established using the edited values, a success message appears. Otherwise, an error message appears. Review the message and address any issues.

. Close the wizard to return to the Grid federation page.

. Confirm that the *Connection status* is *Connected*.

. Securely delete all copies of the verification file.


== [[test_grid_fed_connection]]Test a grid federation connection

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Test the connection using the *Actions* menu on the Grid federation page or the details page for a specific connection.
+
[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Actions menu
--
.. Select the radio button for the connection. 
.. Select *Actions* > *Test*.

--

.Details page
--
.. Select a connection name to display its details.
.. Select *Test connection*.

--

====

. Review the connection status:
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
|Connection status| Description

|Connected
|Both grids are connected and communicating normally.

|Error
|The connection is in an error state. For example, a certificate has expired or a configuration value is no longer valid.

|Pending edit
|You have edited the connection on this grid, but the connection is still using the existing configuration. To complete the edit, upload the new verification file to the other grid.

|Waiting to connect
|You have configured the connection on this grid, but the connection hasn't been completed on the other grid. Download the verification file from this grid and upload it to the other grid.

|Unknown
|The connection is in an unknown state, possibly because a networking issue or an offline node.

|===

. If the Connection status is *Error* resolve any issues. Then, select *Test connection* again to confirm the issue has been fixed.
+
IMPORTANT: You might need to wait up to 30 minutes for the Connection status to be updated. 


== [[rotate_grid_fed_certificates]]Rotate connection certificates

Each grid federation connection uses four automatically-generated SSL certificates to secure the connection. When the two certificates for each grid near their expiration date, the *Expiration of grid federation certificate* alert reminds you to rotate the certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
If the certificates on either end of the connection expire, the connection will stop working and data will no longer be replicated between grids. 


. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node on either grid.
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.
. From either tab on the Grid federation page, select the connection name to display its details.
. Select the *Certificates* tab.
. Select *Rotate certificates*.
. Specify how long the new certificates should be valid for, in days.
. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are signed in to.
. Select *Rotate certificates*.
. As required, repeat these steps on the other grid in the connection.
+
In general, use the same number of days for the certificates on both sides of the connection.


== [[remove_grid_fed_connection]]Remove a grid federation connection

You can remove a grid federation connection from either grid in the connection. As shown in the figure, you must perform prerequisite steps on both grids to confirm that the connection is not being used by any tenant on either grid.

image:../media/grid-federation-remove-connection.png[steps to remove grid federation connection]

IMPORTANT: Removing a connection does not delete any items that have already been copied between grids. For example, any tenant users, groups, and objects that exist on both grids are not deleted from either grid when the tenantâ€™s permission is removed. If you want to delete these items, you must manually delete them from both grids.

Start these steps from either grid in the connection.

=== Remove permission for each tenant

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.
. Select the connection name to display its details.
. On the *Permitted tenants* tab, determine if the connection is being used by any tenants.
. If any tenants are listed, follow the instructions in xref:grid-federation-manage-tenants.adoc[Manage permitted tenants] to remove the *Use grid federation connection* permission from each tenant on each grid.
+
IMPORTANT: You can't remove the *Use grid federation connection* permission if any of the tenant's buckets have cross-grid replication enabled. The tenant account must stop cross-grid replication for all of their buckets first. 

== Remove connection

. When no tenants on either grid are using the connection, select *Remove*.
. Review the confirmation message, and select *Remove*.

* If the connection can be removed, you are returned to the details page and a success message is shown. The grid federation connection is now removed from both grids.

* If the connection can't be removed (for example, it is still in use or there is a connection error), an error message is displayed. You can do either of the following:

** (Recommended.) Resolve the error (see xref:grid-federation-troubleshoot.adoc[Troubleshoot grid federation errors]).
** Remove the connection by force. See the next section.

== [[force-remove_grid_fed_connection]]Remove a grid federation connection by force

If necessary, you can force the removal of a connection that is unhealthy.

. From the confirmation dialog box, select *Force remove*.
+
A success message appears. This grid federation connection can no longer be used. However, tenant buckets might still have cross-grid replication enabled and some object copies might have already been replicated between the grids in the connection. 

. From the other grid in the connection, sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.
. Select the connection name to display its details.
. Select *Remove* and *Yes*.
. Select *Force remove* to remove the other end of the connection.
