Managing a grid federation connection between StorageGRID systems includes viewing and editing connection details, removing the connection, and viewing and rotating the certificates.

== View grid federation connections

You can view details for existing grid federation connections from either grid in the connection. 

* To view basic information for all grid federation connections, go to the Grid federation page and review the table on the *Connections* tab.
+
This table shows the connection name, the remote hostname, and the connection status for each grid federation connection you have added

== Edit a grid federation connection

You can edit a grid federation connection by signing in to the primary Admin Node on either grid in the connection. After you make changes to the first grid, you must download a new verification file and upload it to the other grid.

=== Start editing the connection

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node on either grid.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Edit the connection details using the *Actions* menu on the Grid federation page or the details page for a specific connection.

====

. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are signed in to.
. Select *Save and continue*.
+
The new values are saved, but they will not be applied to the connection until you have uploaded the new verification file on the other grid. 

. Select *Download verification file*.
+
To download this file at a later time, go to the details page for the connection.

. When the green checkmark appears, locate the downloaded file (`_connection-name_.grid-federation`), and save it to a safe location.
+
[IMPORTANT]
The verification file contains secrets and must be securely stored and transmitted.

. Select *Close* to return to the Grid federation page. 

. Confirm that the new connection is shown and that its *Connection status* is *Pending edit*.

. Provide the `_connection-name_.grid-federation` file to the grid admin for the other grid.

=== Finish editing the connection

Perform these steps on the other grid.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Select *Add connection* > *Upload verification file*. 

. Select *Upload verification file*. Then, browse to and select the file that was downloaded from the first grid.

. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are currently signed in to.

. Select *Save and test*.
+
If the connection can be established using the edited values, a success message appears. Otherwise, an error message appears. Review the message and address any issues.

. Close the wizard to return to the Grid federation page.

. Confirm that the *Connection status* is *Connected*.

. Securely delete all copies of the verification file.


== Rotate connection certificates

Each grid federation connection uses four automatically-generated SSL certificates to secure the connection. When the two certificates for each grid near their expiration date, the *Expiration of grid federation certificate* alert reminds you to rotate the certificates.

[IMPORTANT]
If the certificates on either end of the connection expire, the connection will stop working and data will no longer be replicated between grids. 

To rotate the certificates, follow these steps.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node on either grid.
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.
. Select the connection name to display its details.
. Select the *Certificates* tab.
. Select *Rotate certificates*.
. Specify how long the new certificates should be valid for, in days.
. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are signed in to.
. Select *Rotate certificates*.
. As required, repeat these steps on the other grid in the connection.
+
In general, use the same number of days for the certificates on both sides of the connection.

== Remove a grid federation connection

You can remove a grid federation connection if is not being used by any tenant, and you can remove a connection from either grid.

After you remove a connection, you can no longer replicate data between grids. However, any data that was previously replicated between grids is not deleted. If you want to delete this information from either grid, you must delete it manually.

Perform these steps from either grid in the grid federation connection.
