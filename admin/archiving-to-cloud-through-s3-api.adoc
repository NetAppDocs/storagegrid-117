You can configure an Archive Node to connect directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or to any other system that can interface to the StorageGRID system through the S3 API.

[CAUTION]
====
Support for Archive Nodes (for both archiving to the cloud using the S3 API and archiving to tape using TSM middleware) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Moving objects from an Archive Node to an external archival storage system has been replaced by ILM Cloud Storage Pools, which offer more functionality.

See link:../ilm/what-cloud-storage-pool-is.html[Use Cloud Storage Pools].
