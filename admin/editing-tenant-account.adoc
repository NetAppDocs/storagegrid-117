.Steps

. Select *TENANTS*.

. Select the tenant account. You can do either of the following:

**  Select the check box for the tenant, and select *Actions* > *Edit*.

** Select the tenant's name to display the details page, and select *Edit*.

. Optionally, change the values for these fields:
+
* *Name*
* *Description*
* *Storage quota*
 
. Select *Continue*.

. Select or unselect the permissions for the tenant account.
+
* If you disable *Platform services* for a tenant who is already using them, the services that they have configured for their S3 buckets will stop working. No error message is sent to the tenant. For example, if the tenant has configured CloudMirror replication for an S3 bucket, they can still store objects in the bucket, but copies of those objects will no longer be made in the external S3 bucket that they have configured as an endpoint. See xref:manage-platform-services-for-tenants.adoc[Manage platform services for S3 tenant accounts].
+
* Change the setting of the *Uses own identity source* check box to determine whether the tenant account will use its own identity source or the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager.
+
If the *Uses own identity source* check box is:

 ** Disabled and checked, the tenant has already enabled its own identity source. A tenant must disable its identity source before it can use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager.
 ** Disabled and unchecked, SSO is enabled for the StorageGRID system. The tenant must use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager.
+
* Enable or disable *Allow S3 Select* as needed. See xref:manage-s3-select-for-tenant-accounts.adoc[Manage S3 Select for tenant accounts].

* Enable or disable *Allow account clone and cross-grid replication*. 

. Select *Save*.
