Account clone is the automatic replication of a tenant account, tenant groups, tenant users, and, optionally, S3 access keys between the StorageGRID systems in a link:grid-federation-overview.html[grid federation connection]. 

Account clone is required for link:grid-federation-what-is-cross-grid-replication.html[cross-grid replication]. Cloning account information from a source StorageGRID system to a destination StorageGRID system ensures that tenant users and groups can access the corresponding buckets and objects on either grid.

== Workflow for account clone

The workflow diagram shows the steps that grid administrators and permitted tenants will perform to set up account clone. These steps are performed after the link:grid-federation-create-connection.html[grid federation connection is configured].

== How is a tenant account cloned?

After creating a link:grid-federation-overview.html[grid federation connection], a grid admin can create new S3 tenant accounts on either grid. Tenants that are created with the *Use grid federation connection* permission are allowed to use a specific grid federation connection to replicate bucket objects.

When the grid admin saves a new tenant with the *Use grid federation connection* permission, StorageGRID automatically creates a replica of that tenant on the other grid. The grid where the tenant is originally created is known as the tenant's _source grid_. The grid where the tenant is replicated is known as the tenant's _destination grid_. Both tenant accounts have the same account ID, name, storage quota, and assigned permissions, but the tenant replicated to the destination grid does not initially have a root user password.

For details about creating and managing replicated tenant accounts, see
link:grid-federation-manage-tenants.html[Manage permitted tenants for grid federation].

== How are tenant groups, users, and keys cloned?

After a tenant with the *Use grid federation connection* permission is replicated to the destination grid, tenant users can add new tenant groups and users to the source grid. StorageGRID automatically clones new tenant groups and users to the destination tenant, but no cloning occurs from the destination grid back to the source. S3 access keys can be created on either grid, or these keys can optionally be cloned from the source grid to the destination grid if users need to use the same keys on both grids. 

For details about cloning tenant groups, users, and keys, see link:../tenant/grid-federation-account-clone.html[Clone tenant groups and users] and link:../tenant/grid-federation-clone-keys-with-api.html[Clone S3 access keys using the API].

== [[account-clone-sso]]Requirements for account clone and SSO 

If either StorageGRID system in the grid federation connection uses single sign-on (SSO), both grids must use SSO. The grid admins for the tenant's source and destination grids must perform these steps before creating permitted tenant accounts:

. Configure the same identity source for both grids. See link:using-identity-federation.html[Use identity federation].

. Configure the same SSO identity provider (IdP) for both grids. See link:configuring-sso.html[Configure single sign-on].

. link:managing-admin-groups.html[Create the same admin group] on both grids by importing the same federated group.
+
When you create the tenant, you will select this group to have the initial Root access permission for both the source and destination tenant accounts. 
+
NOTE: If this admin group doesn't exist on both grids before you create the tenant, the tenant won't be replicated to the destination.

== [[account-clone-identity-federation]]Requirements for account clone and identity federation

If neither grid uses SSO, you can optionally configure identity federation for the entire grid or grant each tenant permission to configure its own identity source. 

=== Requirements for grid-level identity federation

If either grid in the connection has identity federation configured, both grids must use identity federation. The grid admins for the tenant's source and destination grids must perform these steps before creating tenant accounts:

. Configure the same identity source for both grids. See link:using-identity-federation.html[Use identity federation].

. If you want a federated group to have initial Root access permission for both the source and destination tenant accounts, link:managing-admin-groups.html[create the same admin group] on both grids by importing the same federated group.
+
NOTE: If this admin group doesn't exist on both grids before you create the tenant, the tenant won't be replicated to the destination.

. If you don't want a federated group to have initial Root access permission for both accounts, specify a password for the local root user.

=== Requirements for tenant-level identity federation

If you create a tenant and assign both the *Use grid federation connection* permission and the *Use own identity source* permission, both the source tenant and its replica must link:../tenant/using-identity-federation.html[configure the same identity source] before the source tenant imports any federated groups. Federated groups added to the source grid can't be cloned to the destination unless both grids use the same identity source.
