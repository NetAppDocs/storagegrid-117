[.lead]
The StorageGRID system supports custom certificates encrypted with RSA or ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).

CAUTION: The cipher type must match the server certificate type. For example, RSA ciphers require RSA certificates, and ECDSA ciphers require ECDSA certificates. See xref:../admin/supported-ciphers-for-outgoing-tls-connections.adoc[Supported ciphers for outgoing TLS connections].
