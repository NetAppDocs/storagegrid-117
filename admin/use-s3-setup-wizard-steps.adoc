You can use the S3 application setup wizard to configure StorageGRID for use with an S3 application. The setup wizard provides the values the application needs to access a StorageGRID bucket and to save objects.

NOTE: You must have the Root access permission to access the wizard.

== Access the wizard

. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

. If the *FabricPool and S3 setup wizard* banner appears on the dashboard, select the link in the banner. If the banner no longer appears, select the help icon from the header bar in the Grid Manager and select *FabricPool and S3 Setup Wizard*.
+
image::../media/help_menu.png[help menu]
. In the S3 application section of the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard page, select *Configure now*.
+
*Step 1 of 6: Configure HA group* appears.

== Step 1 of 6: Configure HA group
A high availability (HA) group is a collection of nodes that each contain the StorageGRID Load Balancer service. An HA group can contain Gateway Nodes, Admin Nodes, or both.

You can use an HA group to help keep the S3 application data connections available. If the active interface in the HA group fails, a backup interface can manage the workload with little impact to FabricPool operations.

For details about this task, see xref:../admin/managing-high-availability-groups.adoc[Manage high availability groups] and xref:best-practices-for-high-availability-groups.adoc[Best practices for high availability groups].

. If you plan to use an external load balancer, you do not need to create an HA group. Select *Skip this step* and go to <<Step 2 of 9: Configure load balancer endpoint>>.

. To use the StorageGRID load balancer, you can create a new HA group or use an existing HA group.

== Step 2 of 6: Configure load balancer endpoint

StorageGRID uses a load balancer to manage the workload from client applications, such as FabricPool. Load balancing maximizes speed and connection capacity across multiple Storage Nodes.

You can use the StorageGRID Load Balancer service, which exists on all Gateway and Admin Nodes, or you can connect to an external (third-party) load balancer. Using the StorageGRID load balancer is recommended.

For details about this task, see xref:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.adoc[Configure load balancer endpoints] and xref:best-practices-for-load-balancing.adoc[Best practices for load balancing].

To use the StorageGRID Load Balancer service, select the *StorageGRID load balancer* tab and then create or select the load balancer endpoint you want to use. To use an external load balancer, select the *External load balancer* tab and provide details about the system you have already configured.

// end tabbed area


== Step 3 of 6: Create tenant and bucket

A tenant is an entity that can use S3 applications to store and retrieve objects in StorageGRID. Each tenant has its own users, access keys, buckets, objects, and a specific set of capabilities. You must create a StorageGRID tenant before you can create the bucket that S3 application will use. 

A bucket is a container used to store a tenant's objects and object metadata. Although some tenants might have many buckets, the wizard lets you create or select only one tenant and one bucket at a time. You can use the Tenant Manager later to add any additional buckets you need.

You can create a new tenant and bucket for S3 application use, or you can select an existing tenant and bucket. If you create a new tenant, the system automatically creates the access key ID and secret access key for the tenant's root user.

For details about this task, see xref:creating-s3-bucket-and-access-key.adoc[Create an S3 bucket and obtain an access key].



// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.New tenant and bucket
--

To create a new tenant and bucket:

. Select *Create tenant* and enter the following information for the tenant in the *Enter tenant details*:
+

.. *Name*: Enter a name for the tenant account. For example, `S3 tenant`
.. *Description* (optional): Enter a description that helps you identify the tenant.
.. The *Client type* by default is *S3* and is disabled. 
.. *Storage quota* (optional): If you want this tenant to have a storage quota, enter a numerical value for the quota and select the correct units (GB, TB, or PB).
+
. Select the appropriate permissions for the tenant. Some of these permissions have additional requirements. For details, see the online help for each permission.
+
* Allow platform services
* Use own identity source (selectable only if SSO is not being used)
* Allow S3 select (see xref:manage-s3-select-for-tenant-accounts.adoc[Manage S3 Select for tenant accounts])
 
. Select *Continue* and define root access for the tenant account.

.. Define root access for the tenant account, based on whether your StorageGRID system uses xref:../admin/using-identity-federation.adoc[identity federation], xref:../admin/configuring-sso.adoc[single sign-on (SSO)], or both. 
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Option 
| Do this

|If identity federation is not enabled 
|Specify the password to use when signing into the tenant as the local root user.

|If identity federation is enabled
|Select an existing federated group to have Root access permission for the tenant.

Optionally specify the password to use when signing in to the tenant as the local root user.

|If both identity federation and single sign-on (SSO) are enabled
|Select an existing federated group to have Root access permission for the tenant. No local users can sign in.

|===

.. For *Bucket name*, enter the name of the bucket FabricPool will use to store ONTAP data. For example, `fabricpool-bucket`.
+
IMPORTANT: You cannot change the bucket name after creating the bucket.

.. Select the *Region* for this bucket.
+
Use the default region (us-east-1) unless you expect to use ILM in the future to filter objects based on the bucket's region.

.. Select *Create and Continue* to create the tenant and bucket and to go to the download data step 
--

.Select tenant and bucket
--

The existing tenant account must have at least one bucket that does not have versioning enabled. You cannot select an existing tenant account if no bucket exists for that tenant. 

.. Select the existing tenant from the *Tenant name* drop-down list. 
.. Select the existing bucket from the *Bucket name* drop-down list.
+
FabricPool does not support object versioning, so buckets that have versioning enabled are not shown. 

.. Select *Continue* to go to the download data step. 
--
====

// end tabbed area


== Step 4 of 6: Download ONTAP settings 

. To save the values you've entered so far to a text file, select *Download ONTAP settings*.
+
Later, you can enter these values into ONTAP System Manager. 
+
The file includes the information you need to configure StorageGRID as the object storage system for a FabricPool cloud tier, including: 
+
* Load balancer connection details, including the server name (FQDN), port, and certificate
*	Bucket name 
* Access key ID and secret access key for the root user of the tenant account

. Select *Continue* to go to the ILM storage pool step.


== Step 5 of 6: Select a storage pool
A storage pool is a group of Storage Nodes. When you select a storage pool, you determine which nodes StorageGRID will use to store the data tiered from ONTAP.

For details about this step, see xref:../ilm/ilm/creating-storage-pool.adoc[Create a storage pool].

. From the *Site* drop-down list, select the StorageGRID site you want to use for the data tiered from ONTAP. 
. From the *Storage pool* drop-down list, select the storage pool for that site.
+
The storage pool for a site includes all Storage Nodes at that site.

. Select *Continue* to go to the ILM rule step.

////
== Step 6 of 9: Review ILM rule for FabricPool

Information lifecycle management (ILM) rules control the placement, duration, and ingest behavior for all objects in your StorageGRID system. 

The FabricPool and S3 setup wizard automatically creates the recommended ILM rule for FabricPool use. This rule applies only to the bucket you specified. It uses 2+1 erasure coding at a single site to store the data that is tiered from ONTAP. 

For details about this step, see xref:../ilm/access-create-ilm-rule-wizard.adoc[Create ILM rule] and xref:best-practices-ilm.adoc[Best practices for using ILM with FabricPool data].

. Review the rule details.

This rule only applies to objects that are saved in the bucket you specified.

|Reference time
|Ingest time

The placement instruction starts when objects are initially saved to the bucket.

|Placement instruction
|2+1 erasure coding 

|===

. Sort the retention diagram by *Time period* and *Storage pool* to confirm the placement instruction.

** The *Time period* for the rule is *Day 0 - forever*. *Day 0* means that the rule is applied when data is tiered from ONTAP. *Forever* means that StorageGRID will not delete data that has been tiered from ONTAP unless it receives a delete request from ONTAP.

** The *Storage pool* for the rule is the storage pool you selected. *EC 2+1* means the data will stored using 2+1 erasure coding. Each object will be saved as two data fragments and one parity fragment. The three fragments for each object will be saved to different Storage Nodes at a single site.

. Select *Create and Continue* to create this rule and to go to the ILM policy step.
////

////
== Step 7 of 9: Review and activate ILM policy

After the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard creates the ILM rule for FabricPool use, it creates a proposed ILM policy. You must carefully review this policy before activating it. 

For details about this step, see xref:../ilm/creating-ilm-policy.adoc[Create ILM policy] and xref:best-practices-ilm.adoc[Best practices for using ILM with FabricPool data].

CAUTION: When you activate a new ILM policy, StorageGRID uses that policy to manage the placement, duration, and data protection of all objects in the grid, including existing objects and newly ingested objects. In some cases, activating a new policy can cause existing objects to be moved to new locations.


To review and activate the policy:

. Optionally, update the system-generated *Policy name*. By default, the system appends "`+ FabricPool`" to the name of your active or proposed policy, but you can provide your own name.

. Review the list of rules in the proposed policy.

+
The new FabricPool rule is the first rule in the proposed policy. The other rules are selected as follows:

* If your grid doesn't have a proposed ILM policy, the wizard creates a proposed policy by cloning your active policy.

* If your grid already has a proposed ILM policy, the wizard compares that policy to your active policy. 

** If both policies include the same rules in the same order, the wizard adds the FabricPool rule to the existing proposed policy.

** If your proposed policy contains different rules than the active policy, a message appears. To add the new FabricPool rule to one of these policies, you must either  xref:../ilm/creating-proposed-ilm-policy.adoc[delete or edit your proposed policy from the ILM policies page].
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
|If you want to use 
|Perform these steps

|Active policy 
|. Select *ILM* > *Policies* from the left menu in Grid Manager.
. Select the Proposed policy tab.
. Select *Actions* > *Delete* to remove the existing proposed policy.
. Return to the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard.

The wizard can now clone your active policy to create a new proposed policy. The new FabricPool rule will be added to the top.

|Proposed policy
|. Select *ILM* > *Policies* from the left menu in Grid Manager.
. Select the Proposed policy tab.
. Select *Actions* > *Edit* to edit the existing proposed policy.
. Add the new FabricPool rule to the top.
. Activate the updated policy.
. Go to the traffic classification step.

|===



. Review the order of the rules in the new policy. 
+
Because the FabricPool rule is the first rule, any objects in the FabricPool bucket are placed before the other rules in the policy are evaluated. Objects in any other buckets are placed by subsequent rules in the policy.

. Review the retention diagram to learn how different objects will be retained.

.. Select *Expand all* to see a retention diagram for each rule in the proposed policy.
.. Select *Time period* and *Storage pool* to review the retention diagrams. 

. When you have reviewed the proposed policy, select *Activate and continue* to activate the policy and go to the traffic classification step.

IMPORTANT: Errors in an ILM policy can cause irreparable data loss. Review the policy carefully before activating.
////

== Step 5 of 6: Create traffic classification policy

As an option, the FabricPool and S3 setup wizard can create a traffic classification policy that you can use to monitor the FabricPool workload. The system-created policy uses a matching rule to identify all network traffic related to the bucket you created. This policy monitors traffic only; it does not limit traffic for FabricPool or any other clients. 

For details about this step, see xref:creating-traffic-classification-policy-for-fabricpool.adoc[Create a traffic classification policy for FabricPool].

. Review the policy.

. If you want to create this traffic classification policy, select *Create and continue*. 
+
As soon as FabricPool begins tiering data to StorageGRID, you can go to Traffic Classification Policies page to view network traffic metrics for this policy. Later, you can also add rules to limit other workloads and ensure that the FabricPool workload has the majority of bandwidth. 


. Otherwise, select *Skip this step*.

== Step 6 of 6: Review summary 

. Review the summary.
. Select *Finish*.
+
StorageGRID is now ready to accept data from FabricPool. 

. Go to xref:configure-ontap.adoc[Configure ONTAP System Manager] to enter the saved values and to complete the configuration.
