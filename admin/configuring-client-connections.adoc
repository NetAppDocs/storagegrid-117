As a grid administrator, you manage the configuration options that control how S3 and Swift client applications can connect to your StorageGRID system to store and retrieve data. There are a number of different options to meet different application requirements.

== Configuration workflow

== Information needed to attach StorageGRID to a client application

Before you can attach StorageGRID to an S3 or Swift client application, you must perform configuration steps in StorageGRID and obtain certain value.

=== What values do I need?

The following figure shows the values you must configure in StorageGRID and where those values are used by the S3 or Swift application and the DNS server.

=== How do I get these values?
Depending on your requirements, you can do either of the following to obtain the information you need:

* *Use the xref:use-s3-setup-wizard.adoc[S3 setup wizard]*. The S3 setup wizard helps you to quickly configure the required values in StorageGRID and outputs two files that you can use when you configure the S3 application. The wizard guides you through the required steps and helps to make sure your settings conform to StorageGRID best practices.
+
NOTE: If you are configuring an S3 application, using the S3 setup wizard is recommended unless you know you have special requirements or your implementation will require significant customization. 

* *Configure each item manually*. Then, enter the values into the S3 or Swift application. Follow these steps:
+
. Configure the high availability group you want to use for the S3 or Swift application. See xref:../admin/configure-high-availability-group.adoc[Configure high availability groups].
. Create the load balancer endpoint that the S3 or Swift application will use. See xref:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.adoc[Configure load balancer endpoints].
. Create the tenant account that the S3 or Swift application will use. See xref:../admin/creating-tenant-account.adoc[Create tenant account].
. For an S3 tenant, sign in to the tenant account, and generate an access key ID and secret access key for each user that will access the application. See xref:..tenant/creating-your-own-s3-access-keys.adoc[Create your own access keys].
. Create one or more S3 buckets or Swift containers within the tenant account. For S3, see xref:../tenant/creating-s3-bucket.adoc[Create S3 bucket]. For Swift, use the xref:../swift/container-operations.adoc[PUT container request] to create each container.
