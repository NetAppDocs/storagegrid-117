[.lead]
You can allow new S3 tenant accounts to use a grid federation connection between two StorageGRID systems. When tenants are allowed to use a connection, special steps are required to edit tenant details or to permanently remove a tenant's permission to use the connection.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager on either grid using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission for the grid you are signed in to. 
* You have xref:grid-federation-create-connection.adoc[created a grid federation connection] between two grids.

== Allow tenant to use grid federation connection
If you want to allow a tenant account to use a grid federation connection for account clone and cross-grid replication, follow the general instructions to xref:creating-tenant-account.adoc[create a new S3 tenant] and note the following:

* You must have Root access permission.

* You can create the tenant from either grid in the connection.

* The status of the connection must be *Connected*.

* You can only select the *Use grid federation connection* permission when you are creating a new S3 tenant; you can't enable this permission for an existing tenant.

* When the new tenant is created on the first grid, a new tenant with the same name, the same 20-digit account ID, and the same root user is automatically created on the other grid in the connection. 

* You might need to wait up to 15 minutes for the new tenant to appear in Grid Manager on the other grid.

* After the new tenant is available on both grids, you can sign in to configure users, groups, and access keys for account clone and to create buckets for cross-grid replication.

== Edit tenant with Use grid federation permission

If you need to edit a tenant that has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, follow the general instructions for xref:editing-tenant-account.adoc[editing a tenant account] and note the following:

* If a tenant has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, you can edit tenant details from either grid in the connection. However, any changes you make on one grid in the connection will not be copied to the other grid. If you want to keep the tenant details exactly in sync between grids, you must make the same edits on both grids.

* You can't select (or re-select) the *Use grid federation connection* permission when you are editing an existing tenant.

* If you need to remove the *Use grid federation connection* permission for a tenant, use the Grid federation page as described in the next section. You can't remove this permission by editing the tenant.

== Remove Use grid federation permission

To prevent a tenant from using a grid federation connection, you must remove the *Use grid federation* permission. For example, you might want the tenant to stop cloning account details and bucket objects between grids. As shown in the figure, you must first confirm that the connection is not being used by any tenant on either grid.

Before removing a tenant's permission to use a grid federation connection, note the following:

* Removing the *Use grid federation* permission from a tenant is a permanent action. You cannot re-enable the permission for this tenant.

* You cannot remove the *Use grid federation* permission if any of the tenant's buckets have cross-grid replication enabled. The tenant account must stop cross-grid replication for all of their buckets first. 

* Removing the *Use grid federation* permission does not delete any items that have already been copied between grids. For example, bucket objects that have been replicated are not deleted from either grid when the tenant's permission is removed. If you want to delete these items, you must manually delete them from both grids.

* When you remove the *Use grid federation* permission from a tenant account on one grid, the permission is not removed from the corresponding tenant on the other grid. You must perform this procedure on both grids.

* You must remove the *Use grid connection* permission from all tenants on both sides of the connection before you can remove the grid federation connection itself. See xref:grid-federation-manage-connection.adoc[Manage grid federation connections] for details.

.What you'll need

* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission for both grids. 
* You have confirmed that cross-grid replication is stopped for all tenant buckets.

.Steps

. From either grid in the connection, sign in to the Grid Manager from the primary Admin Node.
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.
. Select the connection name to display its details page.
. On the *Permitted tenants* tab, select radio button for the tenant. 
. Select *Remove permission*.
. Review the warnings in the confirmation dialog box, and select *Remove*.

* If the permission can be removed, you are returned to the details page and a success message is shown. This tenant can no longer use the grid federation connection. Go to the other grid and repeat these steps to remove the permission for the same tenant account on the other grid.

* If one or more tenant buckets still have cross-grid replication enabled, an error is displayed. You can do either of the following:

** (Recommended.) Sign in to the Tenant Manager and stop replication (permanently disable replication) for each of the tenant's buckets. Then, repeat the steps to remove the permission on both grids.
** Remove the permission by force. See the next section.

== [[force_remove_permission]]Force-remove the permission

If necessary, you can force the removal of a tenant's permission to use a grid federation connection even if even if tenant buckets still have cross-grid replication enabled. When the permission is removed, data in these buckets can no longer be copied between the grids

. From the confirmation dialog box, select *Force remove*.
+
A success message appears. This tenant can no longer use the grid federation connection. However, tenant buckets might still have cross-grid replication enabled and some object copies might have already been replicated between the grids in the connection.

. Go to the other grid and repeat these steps to force-remove the permission for the same tenant account on the other grid.
