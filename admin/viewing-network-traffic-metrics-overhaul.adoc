You can monitor network traffic by viewing the graphs that are available from the Traffic classification policies page.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission or the Tenant Accounts permission.

.About this task

For any existing traffic classification policy, you can view metrics for the load balancer service to determine if the policy is successfully limiting traffic across the network. The data in the graphs can help you determine if you need to adjust the policy.

Even if no limits are set for a traffic classification policy, metrics are collected and the graphs provide useful information for understanding traffic trends.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *Traffic classification*.
+

The Traffic classification policies page appears, and the existing policies are listed in the table.
+

NOTE: You must have Root access permission to *Create*, *Edit*, and *Remove* traffic classification policies 

. Press the traffic classification policy name for which you want to view metrics.
. Select *Metrics* tab.
+
The traffic classification policy graphs appear. The graphs display metrics only for the traffic that matches the selected policy.
+
You can select other policies to view by using the selecting the policy name from the list on the left.

The following graphs are included on the web page.

** Request rate: This graph provides the amount of bandwidth matching this policy handled by all load balancers. Received data includes request headers for all requests and body data size for responses that have body data. Sent includes response headers for all requests and response body data size for requests that include body data in the response.
+

NOTE: When requests are complete, this chart only shows bandwidth usage. For slow or large object requests the actual instantaneous bandwidth might differ from the values reported in this graph.
+

** Error response rate: This graph provides an approximate rate at which requests matching this policy are returning errors (HTTP status code >= 400) to clients.

** Average request duration (non-error): This graph provides an average duration of successful requests matching this policy.
+

** Policy bandwidth usage: The amount of bandwidth matching this policy handled by all load balancers. Received data includes request headers for all requests and body data size for responses that have body data. Sent includes response headers for all requests and response body data size for requests that include body data in the response.

. Hover the cursor over a line graph to see a pop-up of values on a specific part of the graph.
+

. Hover the cursor over a heatmap to see a pop-up that shows the date and time of the sample, object sizes that are aggregated into the count, and the number of requests per second during that time period.
+

. Use the *Policy* to select a different policy.
+
The graphs for the selected policy appear.
. Select *Grafana dashboard* right below the Metrics title to view all the dashboard for a policy.
. Alternatively, access the graphs from the *SUPPORT* menu.
 .. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Metrics*.
 .. Select *Traffic Classification Policy* from the *Grafana* section.
 .. Select the policy from the pull-down menu on the upper left of the page.
+
Traffic classification policies are identified by their ID. Policy IDs are listed on the Traffic classification policies page.
. Analyze the graphs to determine how often the policy is limiting traffic and whether you need to adjust the policy.
