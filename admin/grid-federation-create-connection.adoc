[.lead]
You can create a grid federation connection between two StorageGRID systems to synchronize certain tenant account details (_account sync_) or to replicate object data (_cross-grid replication_) between two grids. 

.What you'll need

* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission for both grids.
* You have the provisioning passphrase for both grids.
* You have configured high availability (HA) groups on both grids.
* If you plan to use fully qualified domain names (FQDN) for each grid (recommended), you have added the appropriate entries to your DNS server.


== Start the connection on the first grid

To start a grid federation connection, enter connection details on the first grid and download the verification package.

Perform these steps on the StorageGRID system you want to start the connection from.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Select *Add connection* > *Start a connection*.

. Enter details for the connection.

| Field| Description

|Connection name
|A unique name to help you recognize this connection, for example, Grid A-Grid B connection.

|FQDN or IP for local grid
|The FQDN of the grid you are currently signed into or a VIP address of an HA group on this grid.

|Port
|The port you want to use for this connection. You can enter any value between 1 and 65,535.

Both grids in this grid federation connection will use the same port. You must ensure that no node in the HA groups for either grid uses this port for other connections.

|Certificate valid days
|The number of days you want the security certificate for this grid federation connection to be valid. This value defaults to 730 days (2 years), but you can enter any value between 1 and 762 days.

StorageGRID automatically generates this security certificate when you save the connection.

|Local grid provisioning passphrase 
|The provisioning passphrase for the grid you are signed in to.

|FQDN or IP for remote grid
|The FQDN of the grid you want to connect to or a VIP address of an HA group on the other grid.

. Select *Save and continue*.

. For the Download verification package step, select *Download verification file*.
+
After you save and test the connection on the second grid, you can no longer download the verification package from the first grid.

. When the green checkmark appears, locate the downloaded file (`_connection-name_.grid-federation`), and select *Close*.

== Upload connection details on the second grid

Perform these steps on the StorageGRID system you are connecting to.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. Select *Add connection* > *Upload verification file*. 

. Select *Upload verification file*.

. Browse to the file you downloaded from the other grid (`_connection-name_.grid-federation`) 
+
The details you entered are shown.

. Enter the provisioning passphrase for the grid you are currently signed in to.

. Select *Save and test*.
+
If the connection can be established, a success message appears. Otherwise, an error message appears. Review the message and address any issues.


== View and edit grid federation connections

You can view details for existing grid federation connections. You can also change the connection's name and rotate the associated certificate on both grids before it expires.


* To view basic information for all grid federation connections, review the table on the Grid federation page. 

* To view all details about a specific connection, select the connections's name in the table.

* To edit a grid federation connection, use the *Actions* menu on the Grid federation page or the details page for a specific connection.
+
IMPORTANT: After editing an connection, you might need to wait up to 15 minutes for your changes to be applied.

== Delete a grid federation connection

You can delete a grid federation connection at any time, and you can delete a connection from either grid.

After you delete a connection, you can no longer synchronize tenant account details or replicate object data between grids. However, any account information that was previously sync'ed or any object data that was previously replicated between grids is not deleted. If you want to delete this information from either grid, you must delete it manually.

Perform these steps from either grid in the grid federation connection.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager.

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid federation*.

. On the Grid federation page, select the check box for each connection you want to delete. To delete all connections, select the check box in the table header.

. Select *Delete*.

. Review the confirmation message, and select *Yes*.
