[.lead]
You can control whether Grid Manager and Tenant Manager users are signed out if they are inactive for more than a certain amount of time.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have Root access permission.

.About this task

The browser session timeout defaults between 1 minute and 7 days. If a user's browser session is not active for this amount of time, the session times out.

As required, you can increase or decrease the timeout period by setting the *Sign out inactive users after* option.

[NOTE]
====
Browser session timeout can also be controlled by the following:

* A separate, non-configurable StorageGRID timer, which is included for system security. By default, each user's authentication token expires 16 hours after the user signs in. When a user's authentication expires, that user is automatically signed out, even if the value for the browser session timeout has not been reached. To renew the token, the user must sign back in.
* Timeout settings for the identity provider, assuming SSO is enabled for StorageGRID.
* If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled and a user's browser session times out, the system behaves as if the user selected *Sign out inactive users after* manually. The user must reenter their SSO credentials to access StorageGRID again. See xref:configuring-sso.adoc[Configure single sign-on].

.Steps
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security settings* > *Interface*.
. Select a browser timeout period between 60 seconds and 7 days in *Sign out inactive users after*.
You can select the browser timeout period in either minutes, hours, or days.
