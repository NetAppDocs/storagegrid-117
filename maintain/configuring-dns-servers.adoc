You can add, update, and remove domain name system (DNS) servers, so that you can use fully qualified domain name (FQDN) hostnames rather than IP addresses.

To use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) instead of IP addresses when specifying hostnames for external destinations, specify the IP address of each domain name system (DNS) server you will use. These entries are used for AutoSupport, alert emails, SNMP notifications, platform services endpoints, Cloud Storage Pools, and more.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Maintenance or Root Access permission].
* You have the IP addresses of the DNS servers to configure.

IMPORTANT: Specifying the IP address of at least two and no more than six DNS servers is recommended. If possible, use servers that each site can access locally to ensure that an islanded site can resolve the FQDNs for external destinations. After configuring the grid-wide DNS server list, you can link:modifying-dns-configuration-for-single-grid-node.html[customize the DNS server list for each node].
