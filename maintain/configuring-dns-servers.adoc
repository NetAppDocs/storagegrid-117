You can add, update, and remove domain name system (DNS) servers, so that you can use fully qualified domain name (FQDN) hostnames rather than IP addresses.

To use fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) instead of IP addresses when specifying hostnames for external destinations, specify the IP address of each domain name system (DNS) server you will use. These entries are used for AutoSupport, alert emails, SNMP notifications, platform services endpoints, Cloud Storage Pools, and more.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You have the link:../admin/admin-group-permissions.html[Maintenance or Root Access permission].
* You have the IP addresses of the DNS servers to configure.

.About this task

Specify the IP address of at least two and no more than six DNS servers. If possible, use servers that each site can access locally to ensure that an islanded site can resolve the FQDNs for external destinations. After configuring the grid-wide DNS server list, you can link:modifying-dns-configuration-for-single-grid-node.html[customize the DNS server list for each node].

IMPORTANT: To ensure proper operation, specify no more than three DNS servers. If you specify more than three, it is possible that only three will ever be used because of known OS limitations on some platforms. If  necessary based on routing restrictions in your environment, you can link:modifying-dns-configuration-for-single-grid-node.html[customize the DNS server list] for individual nodes (typically all nodes at a site) to use a different set of up to three DNS servers.
