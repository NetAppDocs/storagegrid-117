As required, you can change the display names that are shown throughout the Grid Manager for the entire grid, each site, and each node. You can update display names safely and whenever you need. 

You can use this procedure to rename a single item, multiple items, or even all items at once. Changing a display name does not affect StorageGRID operations in any way. 

== What is the rename procedure?

When you install StorageGRID initially, you specify the grid name, site names, and node names. These initial names serve as both internal _system names_ and as _display names_. 

System names are required for StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. In contrast, display names (the names shown throughout the Grid Manager) can be updated whenever required. For example, you might want to change display names to fix typos, to implement a different naming convention, or to indicate that a site and all of its nodes have been relocated. You can use this procedure whenever you want and as many times as you want. 

== Where do these name appear?
The following table summarizes where system names and display names are shown in the StorageGRID user interface and in StorageGRID files.

== Display name requirements

Display names for nodes must follow these rules:

* Must be unique across your StorageGRID system.
* Cannot be the same as the system name for any other item in your StorageGRID system.
* Must contain at least 1 and no more than 32 characters.
* Can contain numbers, hyphens (-), and uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Can start or end with a letter or number, but cannot start or end with a hyphen.
* Cannot be all numbers.

Display names for the grid and sites must follow these rules:

* Must be unique across your StorageGRID system.
* Cannot be the same as the system name for any other item in your StorageGRID system.
* Must contain at least 1 and no more than 32 characters.
* Can contain numbers, hyphens (-), and uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Can include spaces.
* Can include these special characters: `= - _ : , . @ !`
* Can start and end with the special characters, including hyphens.
* Can be all numbers or special characters.


== Display name best practices

When renaming multiple items, document your general naming scheme before using this tool. Come up with a system that ensures that names are unique, consistent, and easy to understand at a glance.

You can use any naming convention that fits your organizational requirements. Here are some basic suggestions of what to include:

* *Site indicator*: If you have multiple sites, add a site code to each node name. 
* *Node type*: Node names typically indicate the node's type. You can use abbreviations like `s`, `adm`, `gw`, and `arc` (Storage Node, Admin Node, Gateway Node, and Archive Node).
* *Node number*: If a site contains more than one of a particular type of node, add a unique number to each node's name.

Think twice before adding specific details to the names that are likely to change over time. For example, do not include IP addresses in node names because these addresses can be changed. Similarly, including a rack location or the model number of an appliance-based node might seem helpful in the short-term, but those values can change if you move equipment or upgrade the hardware using the node clone procedure.


=== Example display names 
Suppose your StorageGRID system has three data centers and has nodes of different types at each data center. Your display names might be as simple as these:

* *Grid*: `StorageGRID Deployment`

* *Site*: `Data Center 1`

** `dc1-adm1`
** `dc1-s1`
** `dc1-s2`
** `dc1-s3`
** `dc1-gw1`

* *Site*: `Data Center 2`
** `dc2-adm2`
** `dc2-s1`
** `dc2-s2`
** `dc2-s3`

* *Site*: `Data Center 3`
** `dc3-s1`
** `dc3-s2`
** `dc3-s3`


== How to rename your grid, sites, and nodes

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.
* You have the provisioning passphrase.


=== Select items to rename

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Rename grid, sites, and nodes*.
. Select the items you want to rename.
+
* To change the names of everything (or almost everything) in your system, select *Select all*. Then, optionally unselect any items you do not want to rename. 
* To change the name of your grid, select the check box for the grid. 
* To change the name of a site, select the check box for that site. 
* To change the name of a node, select the check box for that node.

. Select *Continue*.

. Review the table, which includes the items you selected.
+
* The *Display name* column shows the current display name for each item. You will provide new display names in this column.
* The *System name* column shows the name you entered for each item during installation. System names are used for internal StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. For example, the system name for a node might be its hostname.
* The *Type* column indicates the item's type: Grid, Site, or the specific type of node.


=== Propose new display names

You can enter a new display name for each item individually, or you can rename items in bulk. Use the bulk rename tool if item names share a common string that you want to replace with a different string. 

// start tabbed area

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Rename items individually
--
. Enter a new display name for each item in the table.
+
See <<Display name requirements>>.

. Optionally, select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] in the *Remove* column to remove any items you do not want to rename.
. When you are ready to rename all of the items in the table, select *Rename*.
+
A success message is shown. The new display names are now used throughout Grid Manager.


--
.Rename items in bulk
--
. Select *Use bulk rename tool*.
+
The list includes all items that were shown in the Proposed names step.

. In the *Match* field, enter the shared string you want to replace. For example, if the string you want to replace is `Data-Center-1`, enter *Data-Center-1*.
+
As you type, your text is highlighted wherever it is found in the names on the left.


. Optionally, select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove any items that you do not want to rename with this tool. 
+
For example, suppose you want to rename all nodes that contain the string `Data-Center-1`, but you do not want to rename the `Data-Center-1` site itself.  Select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove the site from the list.
+

. In the *Rename to* field, enter the replacement string you want to use instead. For example, enter *DC1*.
+
See <<Display name requirements>>.
+
As you enter the replacement string, the names on the left are updated, so you can verify that the new names will be correct.
+ 

image::../media/rename-bulk-rename-tool-after.png[Bulk rename tool after]

. When you are satisfied with the new proposed names, select *Add names* to add the names to the Propose new names table. 

. Make any additional changes required.

. When you are ready to rename all items in the table, select *Rename*.
+
A success message is shown. The new display names are now used throughout Grid Manager.

// end tabbed area


=== Download the recovery package

When you are done renaming items, download and save a new Recovery Package. The new display names for the items you renamed are included in the `passwords.txt` file. 


. Enter the provisioning passphrase and select *Download recovery package*.
+
The download starts immediately.

. When the download completes:

.. Open the `.zip` file.

.. Confirm it includes a gpt-backup directory and an inner `.zip` file.

.. Extract the inner `.zip` file.

.. Confirm you can open the `Passwords.txt` file.

. Copy the downloaded Recovery Package file (`.zip`) to two safe, secure, and separate locations.
+
IMPORTANT:	The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.
