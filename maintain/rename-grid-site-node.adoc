As required, you can change the display names that are shown throughout the Grid Manager for the entire grid, each site, and each node. You can update display names safely and whenever you need. 

You can use this procedure to rename a single item, multiple items, or even all items at once. Changing a display name does not affect StorageGRID operations in any way. 

== What the rename procedure does

When you install StorageGRID initially, you specify a grid name, site names, and node names. These initial names serve as both internal _system names_ and as _display names_. 

System names are required for StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. In contrast, display names (the names shown throughout the Grid Manager) can be updated whenever required. 

For example, you might want to change display names to fix typos, to implement different node-naming conventions, or to indicate that a site and all of its nodes have been relocated. You can use this procedure whenever you want and as many times as you want. 

== Display name requirements and best practices

Display names must be unique across your StorageGRID system.

== How to rename your grid, sites, and nodes

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.
* You have the provisioning passphrase.


=== Select items to rename

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Task* > *Rename*.
. Select the items you want to rename.
+
* To change the names of everything (or almost everything) in your system, select *Select all*. Then, optionally unselect any items you do not want to rename. 
* To change the name of your grid, select the check box for the grid. 
* To change the name of a site, select the check box for that site. 
* To change the name of a node, select the check box for that node.

. Select *Continue*.

. Review the table, which includes the items you selected.
+
* The *Display name* column shows the current display name for each item. You will provide new display names in this column.
* The *System name* column shows the name you entered for each item during installation. System names are used for internal StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. For example, the system name for a node might be its hostname.
* The *Type* column indicates the item's type: Grid, Site, or the specific type of node.


=== Propose new display names

You can enter a new display name for each item individually, or you can rename items in bulk. Use the bulk rename tool if item names share a common string that you want to replace with a different string.

.. Confirm you can open the `Passwords.txt` file.

. Copy the downloaded Recovery Package file (`.zip`) to two safe, secure, and separate locations.
