As required, you can change the display names that are shown throughout the Grid Manager for the entire grid, each site, and each node. You can update display names safely and whenever you need&#8212;changing an item's display name does not affect StorageGRID operations in any way. You can use this procedure to rename a single item, multiple items, or even all items at once.

When you install StorageGRID initially, you specify a grid name, site names, and node names. These names are shown throughout the Grid Manager: on the Nodes pages, on the ILM pages, in alerts, and in various maintenance procedures.

After your system is installed, you can use this procedure to update these names. For example, you can fix any typos, implement different node-naming conventions, or indicate that a site and all of its nodes have been moved to a different location. You can use this procedure whenever you want and as many times as you want. 

When you rename items with this procedure, you are changing an item's _display name_ only. The item's underlying _system name_ and unique ID remain unchanged. Unlike display names, these internal identifiers are required for StorageGRID operations and cannot be updated.

== Display name requirements and best practices

Display names must be unique across your StorageGRID system.

== How to rename your grid, sites, and nodes

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.
* You have the provisioning passphrase.


=== Select items to rename

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Task* > *Rename*.
. Select the items you want to rename.
+
* To change the names of everything (or almost everything) in your system, select *Select all*. Then, optionally unselect any items you do not want to rename. 
* To change the name of your grid, select the check box for the grid. 
* To change the name of a site, select the check box for that site. 
* To change the name of a node, select the check box for that node.

. Select *Continue*.

. Review the table, which includes the items you selected.
+
* The *Display name* column shows the current display name for each item. You will provide new display names in this column.
* The *System name* column shows the name you entered for each item during installation. System names are used for internal StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. For example, the system name for a node might be its hostname.
* The *Type* column indicates the item's type: Grid, Site, or the specific type of node.


=== Propose new display names

You can enter a new display name for each item individually, or you can rename items in bulk. Use the bulk rename tool if item names share a common string that you want to replace with a different string.
