You can use this procedure to add or update the display names used for your grid, sites, and nodes. You can rename a single item, multiple items, or even all items at once. Defining or updating a display name does not affect StorageGRID operations in any way. 

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.
* You have the provisioning passphrase.
* You understand the requirements and best practices for display names. See xref:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.adoc[Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview].


== Select items to rename

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Rename grid, sites, and nodes*.
. For the *Select names* step, select the items you want to rename.
+
* To change the names of everything (or almost everything) in your system, select *Select all*. Then, optionally unselect any items you do not want to rename. 
* To change the name of your grid, select the check box for the grid. 
* To change the name of a site and its nodes, select the check box in the table header for the site. Then, optionally unselect any nodes you do not want to rename.
* To change the name of a site, select the check box for that site.  
* To change the name of a node, select the check box for that node.

. Select *Continue*.

. Review the table, which includes the items you selected.
+
* The *Current display name* column shows the current name for each item. If the item has never been renamed, its display name is the same as its system name.
* The *System name* column shows the name you entered for each item during installation. System names are used for internal StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. For example, the system name for a node might be its hostname.
* The *Type* column indicates the item's type: Grid, Site, or the specific type of node.


== Propose new names

For the *Propose new names* step, you can enter a display name for each item individually, or you can rename items in bulk. Use the bulk rename tool if item names share a common string that you want to replace with a different string.

.Rename items individually
--
. In the *Current display name* field, enter a proposed display name for each item in the table.
+
See xref:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.adoc[Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview] to learn the naming requirements.

. Select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] in the *Remove* column to remove any items you don't want to rename. If you are not proposing a new name for an item, you must remove it from the list.

. When you have proposed new names for all items in the table, select *Rename*.
+
A success message appears. The new display names are now used throughout Grid Manager.


--
.Rename items in bulk
--
. For the *Propose new names* step, select *Use bulk rename tool*.
+
The *Rename preview* includes all items that were shown for the *Propose new names* step. You can use the preview to see how display names will look after you replace a shared string.

. In the *Existing string* field, enter the shared string you want to replace. For example, if the string you want to replace is `Data-Center-1`, enter *Data-Center-1*.
+
As you type, your text is highlighted wherever it is found in the names on the left.


. Optionally, select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove any items that you do not want to rename with this tool. 
+
For example, suppose you want to rename all nodes that contain the string `Data-Center-1`, but you do not want to rename the `Data-Center-1` site itself.  Select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove the site from the rename preview.
+

. In the *New string* field, enter the replacement string you want to use instead. For example, enter *DC1*.
+
See xref:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.adoc[Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview] to learn the naming requirements.
+
As you enter the replacement string, the names on the left are updated, so you can verify that the new names will be correct.
+

. When you are satisfied with the names shown in the preview, select *Add names* to add the names to the table for the *Propose new names* step. 

. Make any additional changes required, or select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove any items that you do not want to rename.

. When you are ready to rename all items in the table, select *Rename*.
+
A success message is shown. The new display names are now used throughout Grid Manager.

== Download the recovery package

When you are done renaming items, download and save a new Recovery Package. The new display names for the items you renamed are included in the `passwords.txt` file. 


. Enter the provisioning passphrase.
. Select *Download Recovery Package*.
+
The download starts immediately.

. When the download completes:

.. Open the `.zip` file.

.. Confirm it includes a `gpt-backup` directory and an inner `.zip` file.

.. Extract the inner `.zip` file.

.. Confirm you can open the `Passwords.txt` file.

. Copy the downloaded Recovery Package file (`.zip`) to two safe, secure, and separate locations.
+
IMPORTANT:	The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.
