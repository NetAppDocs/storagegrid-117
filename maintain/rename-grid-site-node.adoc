You can use this procedure to add or update the display names used for your grid, sites, and nodes. You can rename a single item, multiple items, or even all items at once. Defining or updating a display name does not affect StorageGRID operations in any way. 

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Maintenance or Root access permission.
* You have the provisioning passphrase.
* You understand the requirements and best practices for display names. See xref:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.adoc[Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview].

== How to rename grid, sites, or nodes
Follow these steps to rename your grid, one or more sites, or one or more nodes.

=== Select items to rename

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Rename grid, sites, and nodes*.
. For the *Select names* step, select the items you want to rename.
+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===

|Item to change
|Instruction

|Names of everything (or almost everything) in your system
|. Select *Select all*. 
. Optionally unselect any items you do not want to rename.

|Name of the grid
|Select the check box for the grid. 

|Name of a site and some or all of its nodes
|. Select the check box in the table header for the site. 
. Optionally, unselect any nodes you do not want to rename.

|Name of a site
|Select the check box for the site.

|Name of a node
|Select the check box for the node.

|===

. Select *Continue*.
. Review the table, which includes the items you selected.
+
* The *Display name* column shows the current name for each item. If the item has never been renamed, its display name is the same as its system name.
* The *System name* column shows the name you entered for each item during installation. System names are used for internal StorageGRID operations and cannot be changed. For example, the system name for a node might be its hostname.
* The *Type* column indicates the item's type: Grid, Site, or the specific type of node.


=== Propose new names

For the *Propose new names* step, you can enter a display name for each item individually, or you can rename items in bulk. Use the bulk rename tool if item names share a common string that you want to replace with a different string.

.Rename items individually
--

. In the *Display name* field, enter a proposed display name for each item in the list.
+
See xref:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.adoc[Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview] to learn the naming requirements.

. To remove any items you don't want to rename, select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] in the *Remove from list* column.
+
If you will not be proposing a new name for an item, you must remove it from the table.


. When you have proposed new names for all items in the table, select *Rename*.
+
A success message appears. The new display names are now used throughout Grid Manager.


--
.Rename items in bulk
--
. For the *Propose new names* step, select *Use bulk rename tool*.
+
The *Rename preview* includes all items that were shown for the *Propose new names* step. You can use the preview to see how display names will look after you replace a shared string.

. In the *Existing string* field, enter the shared string you want to replace. For example, if the string you want to replace is `Data-Center-1`, enter *Data-Center-1*.
+
As you type, your text is highlighted wherever it is found in the names on the left.

. Select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove any items that you do not want to rename with this tool. 
+
For example, suppose you want to rename all nodes that contain the string `Data-Center-1`, but you do not want to rename the `Data-Center-1` site itself.  Select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove the site from the rename preview.
+

. In the *New string* field, enter the replacement string you want to use instead. For example, enter *DC1*.
+
See xref:../maintain/rename-grid-site-node-overview.adoc[Rename grid, sites, and nodes: Overview] to learn the naming requirements.
+
As you enter the replacement string, the names on the left are updated, so you can verify that the new names will be correct.
+

. When you are satisfied with the names shown in the preview, select *Add names* to add the names to the table for the *Propose new names* step. 

. Make any additional changes required, or select image:../media/icon-x-to-remove.png[X icon] to remove any items that you do not want to rename.

. When you are ready to rename all items in the table, select *Rename*.
+
A success message is shown. The new display names are now used throughout Grid Manager.

=== Download the recovery package

When you are done renaming items, download and save a new Recovery Package. The new display names for the items you renamed are included in the `Passwords.txt` file. 

. Enter the provisioning passphrase.
. Select *Download Recovery Package*.
+
The download starts immediately.

. When the download completes open the `Passwords.txt` file to see the server name for all nodes and the display names for any renamed nodes. 

. Copy the `sgws-recovery-package-_nnn_.zip` file to two safe, secure, and separate locations.
+
IMPORTANT:	The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

. Select *Finish* to return to the first step.

== Revert display names back to system names
You can revert a renamed grid, site, or node back to its original system name. When you revert an item back to its system name, Grid Manager pages and other StorageGRID locations no longer show a *Display name* for that item. Only the item's system name is shown.

. Select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Rename grid, sites, and nodes*.
. For the *Select names* step, select any items you want to revert back to their system names.

. Select *Continue*.

. For the *Propose new names* step, revert back to system names individually, or revert items in bulk.
