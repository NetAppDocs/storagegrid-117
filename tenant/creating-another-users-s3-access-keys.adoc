[.lead]
If you are using an S3 tenant and you have the appropriate permission, you can create, view, and delete S3 access keys for other users, such as applications that need access to buckets and objects.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the xref:tenant-management-permissions.adoc[Root access permission].

.About this task

You can create one or more S3 access keys for other users so they can create and manage buckets for their tenant account. After you create a new access key, update the application with the new access key ID and secret access key. For security, do not create more keys than the user needs, and delete the keys that are not being used. If you have only one key and it is about to expire, create a new key before the old one expires, and then delete the old one.

Each key can have a specific expiration time or no expiration. Follow these guidelines for expiration time:

* Set an expiration time for the keys to limit the user's access to a certain time period. Setting a short expiration time can help reduce risk if the access key ID and secret access key are accidentally exposed. Expired keys are removed automatically.
* If the security risk in your environment is low and you do not need to periodically create new keys, you do not have to set an expiration time for the keys. If you decide later to create new keys, delete the old keys manually.

IMPORTANT: The S3 buckets and objects belonging to a user can be accessed using the access key ID and secret access key displayed for that user in the Tenant Manager. For this reason, protect access keys as you would a password. Rotate access keys on a regular basis, remove any unused keys from the account, and never share them with other users.

== Create access keys

. Select the user whose S3 access keys you want to manage.

. Select *Finish*.
+
The new key is listed on the Access keys tab of the user details page.

. If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, optionally use the Tenant Management API to manually clone S3 access keys from the tenant on the source grid to the tenant on the destination grid. See xref:grid-federation-clone-keys-with-api.adoc[Clone S3 access keys using the API].

== View access keys

If you are using an S3 tenant and you have appropriate permissions, you can view another user's S3 access keys. You can sort the list by expiration time so you can determine which keys will expire soon. As needed, you can create new keys and delete keys that are no longer in use.

. Select *ACCESS MANAGEMENT* > *Users*.
+
The Users page appears and lists the existing users.

. Select the user whose S3 access keys you want to view.
+
The User details page appears.

. Select *Access keys*.
+

. Sort the keys by *Expiration time* or *Access key ID*.

. As needed, create new keys and manually delete keys that the are no longer in use.
+
If you create new keys before the existing keys expire, the user can begin using the new keys without temporarily losing access to the objects in the account.
+
Expired keys are removed automatically.

== Delete another user's S3 access keys

If you are using an S3 tenant and you have appropriate permissions, you can delete another user's S3 access keys. After an access key is deleted, it can no longer be used to access the objects and buckets in the tenant account.

. Select *ACCESS MANAGEMENT* > *Users*.
+
The Users page appears and lists the existing users.

. Select the user whose S3 access keys you want to manage.
+
The User details page appears.

. Select *Access keys*, and then select the check box for each access key you want to delete.
. Select *Actions* > *Delete selected key*.
+
A confirmation dialog box appears.
