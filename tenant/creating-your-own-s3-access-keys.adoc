If you are using an S3 tenant and you have the appropriate permission, you can create, view, and delete your own S3 access keys. You must have an access key to access your buckets and objects in the S3 tenant account.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].
* You belong to a user group that has the link:tenant-management-permissions.html[Manage your own S3 credentials or Root access permission].

.About this task

You can create one or more S3 access keys that allow you to create and manage buckets for your tenant account. After you create a new access key, update the application with your new access key ID and secret access key. For security, do not create more keys than you need, and delete the keys you are not using. If you have only one key and it is about to expire, create a new key before the old one expires, and then delete the old one.

Each key can have a specific expiration time or no expiration. Follow these guidelines for expiration time:

* Set an expiration time for your keys to limit your access to a certain time period. Setting a short expiration time can help reduce your risk if your access key ID and secret access key are accidentally exposed. Expired keys are removed automatically.
* If the security risk in your environment is low and you do not need to periodically create new keys, you do not have to set an expiration time for your keys. If you decide later to create new keys, delete the old keys manually.

CAUTION: The S3 buckets and objects belonging to your account can be accessed using the access key ID and secret access key displayed for your account in the Tenant Manager. For this reason, protect access keys as you would a password. Rotate access keys on a regular basis, remove any unused keys from your account, and never share them with other users.

== Create access keys

. Select *STORAGE (S3)* > *My access keys*.
+
The My access keys page appears and lists any existing access keys.

. Copy the access key ID and the secret access key to a safe location, or select *Download .csv* to save a spreadsheet file containing the access key ID and secret access key.

. Select *Finish*.
+
The new key is listed on the My access keys page.

. If your tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, optionally use the Tenant Management API to manually clone S3 access keys from the tenant on the source grid to the tenant on the destination grid. See link:grid-federation-clone-keys-with-api.html[Clone S3 access keys using the API].

== View access keys

If you are using an S3 tenant and you have the appropriate permission, you can view a list of your S3 access keys. You can sort the list by expiration time, so you can determine which keys will expire soon.

. Select *STORAGE (S3)* > *My access keys*.
+
The My access keys page appears and lists any existing access keys.
+
image::../media/access_keys_view_list.png[List of Access Keys]

. Sort the keys by *Expiration time* or *Access key ID*.

. As needed, create new keys and manually delete keys that you are no longer using.
+
If you create new keys before the existing keys expire, you can begin using the new keys without temporarily losing access to the objects in the account.
+
Expired keys are removed automatically.

== Delete access keys

If you are using an S3 tenant and you have the appropriate permission, you can delete your own S3 access keys. After an access key is deleted, it can no longer be used to access the objects and buckets in the tenant account.

. Select *STORAGE (S3)* > *My access keys*.
+
The My access keys page appears and lists any existing access keys.

. Select the check box for each access key you want to remove.

. Select *Delete key*.
+
A confirmation dialog box appears.
+

. Select *Delete key*.
+
A confirmation message appears in the upper right corner of the page.
