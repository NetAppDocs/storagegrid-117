[.lead]
You access the Tenant Manager by entering the URL for the tenant into the address bar of a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

.What you'll need

* You have your login credentials.
* You have a URL for accessing the Tenant Manager, as supplied by your grid administrator. The URL will look like one of these examples:
+
----
https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP/
----
+
----
https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port/
----
+
----
https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP/?accountId=20-digit-account-id
----
+
----
https://FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port/?accountId=20-digit-account-id
----
+
The URL always contains either the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or the IP address used to access an Admin Node, and could optionally also include a port number, the 20-digit tenant account ID, or both.

* If the URL does not include the tenant's 20-digit account ID, you have this account ID.
* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* Cookies are enabled in your web browser.
* You have specific access permissions.

.Steps
. Launch a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
. In the browser's address bar, enter the URL for accessing Tenant Manager.
. If you are prompted with a security alert, install the certificate using the browser's installation wizard.
. Sign in to the Tenant Manager.
+
The sign-in screen that you see depends on the URL you entered and whether your organization is using single sign-on (SSO).
