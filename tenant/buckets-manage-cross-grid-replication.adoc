If a tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission, you can use cross-grid replication to automatically replicate bucket objects between two StorageGRID systems for disaster recovery.

Before you can use cross-grid replication, you must sign in to the corresponding tenant accounts on each grid and create identical buckets on each grid. Then, you can enable cross-grid replication to occur in one direction or in both directions.

.What you'll need

* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* The tenant account has the *Use grid federation connection* permission and an identical tenant account was automatically cloned to the other grid. 
* You have the credentials needed to sign in to both tenant accounts as a user with the Root Access permission.
* If more than one grid federation connection is allowed for this tenant, you know which connection to choose.

== Create two identical buckets

. Starting from either grid in the grid federation connection, create a new bucket:

.. Sign in to the tenant account.
.. Follow the instructions to xref:creating-s3-bucket.adoc[create an S3 bucket].
.. On the *Manage object settings* tab, select *Enable object versioning*.
.. If S3 Object Lock is enabled for your StorageGRID system, do not enable S3 Object Lock for the bucket. 
.. Select *Create bucket*.
.. Select *Go to bucket details page*.

. Repeat these steps to create an identical bucket for the same tenant account on the other grid in the grid federation connection. 

== Enable cross-grid replication

Perform these steps before adding any objects to either bucket. Neither bucket can use bucket-level encryption.

As shown in the figure, you can enable cross-grid replication for either or both of the buckets:

* If you enable cross-grid replication for the bucket on only one grid, objects added to that bucket are replicated to the other grid, but objects added to the other bucket are not.
* If you enable cross-grid replication for the bucket on both grids, objects added to either bucket are replicated to the other grid.

. Starting from a grid whose objects you want to replicate, enable cross-grid replication for the bucket:

.. Sign in to the tenant account for the bucket.

.. Select *View buckets* from the dashboard, or select  *STORAGE (S3)* > *Buckets*.

.. Select the bucket name from the table to access the bucket details page.

.. Select the *Cross-grid replication* tab.

.. Review the list of requirements.

.. If all requirements have been met, select the grid federation connection you want to use.

.. Select *Enable and test*.

After a few moments, a success message appears. Objects added to this bucket will now be automatically replicated to the other grid. *Cross-grid replication* is shown as an enabled feature on the bucket details page.

. Optionally, go to the corresponding bucket on the other grid and enable cross-grid replication in the other direction.

== Test replication between grids

Optionally, to test that cross-grid replication is configured correctly:

. Using an S3 application, upload one or two small test objects to a bucket that is configured for cross-grid replication.

. From the bucket details page for that grid, confirm that the objects have been added to the bucket.

. Wait a few minutes, sign in to the tenant account on the other grid, and confirm that the objects have been automatically replicated to the corresponding bucket on that grid.

. If you enabled cross-grid replication for both buckets, repeat these steps with different test objects to confirm that cross-grid replication is working in the other direction as well.

== Disable cross-grid replication

You can permanently stop cross-grid replication if you no longer want to copy objects between corresponding buckets on another grid. 

Before stopping cross-grid replication, note the following:

* Stopping cross-grid replication for a bucket is a permanent action. You cannot restart replication after it has been stopped.

* If cross-grid replication was enabled for each of the buckets (that is, if it is occurring in both directions), you can stop cross-grid replication for either or both buckets. For example, you might want to stop replicating objects from `my-bucket` on Grid 1 to `my-bucket` on Grid 2, while continuing to replicate objects from `my-bucket` on Grid 2 to `my-bucket` on Grid 1.

* Stopping cross-grid replication does not remove any objects that have already been copied between grids. For example, objects in `my-bucket`  on Grid 1 that have been copied to `my-bucket` on Grid 2 are not removed if you stop cross-grid replication for the bucket. If you want to delete these objects, you must remove them manually.

* You must stop cross-grid replication for the bucket on each side of the grid federation connection before you can delete that bucket or remove the grid federation connection. See xref:grid-federation-manage-connection.adoc[Manage grid federation connections] for details.

.What you'll need

* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root access permission for the tenant account on both grids. 

.Steps

. Starting from the grid whose objects you no longer want to replicate, stop cross-grid replication for the bucket:

.. Sign in to the tenant account for the bucket.

.. Select *View buckets* from the dashboard, or select  *STORAGE (S3)* > *Buckets*.

.. Select the bucket name from the table to access the bucket details page.

.. Select the *Cross-grid replication* tab.

.. Select *Stop replication*.

.. If you are sure you want to disable cross-grid replication for this bucket, type *Yes* in the text box, and select *Disable*.

+
After a few moments, a success message appears. New objects added to this bucket can no longer be automatically replicated to the other grid. *Cross-grid replication* is no longer shown as a Enabled feature on the Buckets page.

. Optionally, go to the corresponding bucket on the other grid and stop cross-grid replication back to this bucket.
