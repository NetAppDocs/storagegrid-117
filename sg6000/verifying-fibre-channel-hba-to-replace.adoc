//+
//NOTE: If the serial number of the storage appliance containing the NIC you are replacing starts with the letter Q, it will not be listed in the Grid Manager. You must check the tags attached to the front of each SG6000-CN controller in the data center until you find a match.

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a link:../admin/web-browser-requirements.html[supported web browser].

.Steps

. From the Grid Manager, select *NODES*.
. From the table on the Nodes page, select an appliance Storage Node.
. Select the *Hardware* tab.

 ** If the StorageGRID Appliance section does not display, the node selected is not a StorageGRID appliance. Select a different node from the tree view.
 ** If the Appliance Model is not SGF6112, select a different node from the tree view.
 ** If the serial numbers do not match, select a different node from the tree view.

. After you locate the node where the NIC needs to be replaced, write down the BMC IP address listed the StorageGRID Appliance section.
+
You can use this IP address to turn on the compute controller identify LED, to help you locate the appliance in the data center.
