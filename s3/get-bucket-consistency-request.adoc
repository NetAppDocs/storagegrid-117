[.lead]
The GET Bucket consistency request allows you to determine the consistency level being applied to a particular bucket.

The default consistency controls are set to guarantee read-after-write for newly created objects.

You have the s3:GetBucketConsistency permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

== Response

In the response XML, `<Consistency>` will return one of the following values:

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Consistency control| Description

|all
|All nodes receive the data immediately, or the request will fail.

|strong-global
|Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.

|strong-site
|Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.

|read-after-new-write
|(Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Most closely matches Amazon S3 consistency guarantees.

*Note:* If your application uses HEAD requests on objects that do not exist, you might receive a high number of 500 Internal Server errors if two or more Storage Nodes at the same site are unavailable. To prevent these errors, set the consistency control to "`available`" unless you require consistency guarantees similar to Amazon S3.

|available (eventual consistency for HEAD operations)
|Behaves the same as the "`read-after-new-write`" consistency level, but only provides eventual consistency for HEAD operations. Offers higher availability for HEAD operations than "`read-after-new-write`" if Storage Nodes are unavailable. Differs from Amazon S3 consistency guarantees for HEAD operations only.
