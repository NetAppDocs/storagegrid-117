You can modify ILM rules and the ILM policy as your storage requirements change.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.

== Remove an ILM rule

To keep the list of current ILM rules manageable, remove any ILM rules that you are not likely to use.

.Steps

To remove an ILM rule that is currently used in the active policy or in the proposed policy:

. Clone the active policy or edit the proposed policy.
. Remove the ILM rule from the policy.
. Save, simulate, and activate the new policy to make sure objects are protected as expected.

To remove an ILM rule that is not currently used:

. Select *ILM* > *Rules*.
. Confirm that the rule you want to remove is not used in the active policy or the proposed policy.
. If the rule you want to remove is not in use, select the rule and select *Delete*. You can select multiple rules and remove all of them at the same time.
. Select *Yes* to confirm that you want to remove the ILM rule.
+
The ILM rule is removed.
+
NOTE: If you remove a rule that is used in a historical policy, an image:../media/icon_ilm_rule_historical.png[Icon ILM Rule Historical] icon appears for the rule when you view the policy, which indicates that the rule has become a historical rule.

== Edit an ILM rule

You might need to edit an ILM rule to change a filter or placement instruction.

You cannot edit a rule if it is being used in the active ILM policy or the proposed ILM policy. Instead, you can clone these rules and make any required changes to the cloned copy. You also cannot edit the stock ILM rule (Make 2 Copies) or ILM rules created before StorageGRID version 10.3.

NOTE: Before adding an edited rule to the active ILM policy, be aware that a change to an object's placement instructions might cause an increased load on the system.

.Steps
. Select *ILM* > *Rules*.
. Confirm that the rule you want to edit is not used in the active ILM policy or the proposed ILM policy.
. If the rule you want to edit is not in use, select the rule and select *Edit*.
. Complete the pages of the Edit ILM rule wizard. As necessary, follow the steps for xref:create-ilm-rule-enter-details.adoc[creating an ILM rule] and xref:create-ilm-rule-enter-details.adoc#use-advanced-filters-in-ilm-rules[using advanced filters in ILM rules].
+
When editing an ILM rule, you cannot change its name.

. Select *Save*.
+
NOTE: If you edit a rule that is used in a historical policy, an image:../media/icon_ilm_rule_historical.png[Icon ILM Rule Historical] icon appears for the rule when you view the policy, which indicates that the rule has become a historical rule.

== Clone an ILM rule

You cannot edit a rule if it is being used in the proposed ILM policy or the active ILM policy. Instead, you can clone a rule and make any required changes to the cloned copy. Then, if required, you can remove the original rule from the proposed policy and replace it with the modified version. You cannot clone an ILM rule if it was created using StorageGRID version 10.2 or earlier.

Before adding a cloned rule to the active ILM policy, be aware that a change to an object's placement instructions might cause an increased load on the system.

.Steps

. Select *ILM* > *Rules*.
. Select the rule you want to clone and select *Clone*.
. Update the cloned rule by following the steps for <<Edit an ILM rule,editing an ILM rule>> and xref:create-ilm-rule-enter-details.adoc#use-advanced-filters-in-ilm-rules[using advanced filters in ILM rules].
+
When cloning an ILM rule, you must enter a new name.
. Select *Save*.
+
The new ILM rule is created.

== View ILM metrics

You can view metrics for ILM, such as the number of objects in the queue and the evaluation rate. You can monitor these metrics to determine system performance. A large queue or evaluation rate might indicate that the system is not able to keep up with the ingest rate, the load from the client applications is excessive, or that some abnormal condition exists.

.Steps

. Select *Dashboard* > *ILM*.

. Monitor the metrics on the ILM tab.
+
You can select the question mark image:../media/icon_nms_question.png[question mark icon] to see a description of the items on the ILM tab.
