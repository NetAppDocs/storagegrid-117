[.lead]
You can use the following example rules and policy as a starting point when defining an ILM policy to meet your object protection and retention requirements.

CAUTION: The following ILM rules and policy are only examples. There are many ways to configure ILM rules. Before activating a new policy, simulate the proposed policy to confirm it will work as intended to protect content from loss.

== ILM rule 1 for example 1: Copy object data to two sites

This example ILM rule copies object data to storage pools in two sites.

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Rule definition| Example value
|Storage Pools
|Two storage pools, each at different sites, named Site 1 and Site 2.

|Rule name
|Two Copies Two Sites

|Reference time
|Ingest time

|Content Placement
|On Day 0, keep two replicated copies forever--one in Site 1 and one in Site 2.

== ILM rule 2 for example 1: erasure coding profile with bucket matching

This example ILM rule uses an erasure coding profile and an S3 bucket to determine where and how long the object is stored.

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| Rule definition| Example value
|Erasure Coding Profile
|
* One storage pool across three sites (All 3 sites)
* Use 6+3 erasure-coding scheme

|Rule name
|EC for S3 Bucket finance-records

|Reference time
|Ingest time

|Content Placement
|For objects in the S3 bucket named finance-records, create one erasure-coded copy in the pool specified by the erasure coding profile. Keep this copy forever.
|===

== ILM policy for example 1

In practice, most ILM policies are simple, even though the StorageGRID system allows you to design sophisticated and complex ILM policies.

A typical ILM policy for a multi-site topology might include ILM rules such as the following:

* At ingest, use 6+3 erasure coding to store all objects belonging to the S3 bucket named `finance-records` across three sites.
* If an object does not match the first ILM rule, use the policy's default ILM rule, Two Copies Two Sites, to store a copy of that object in two data centers, Site 1 and Site 2.
